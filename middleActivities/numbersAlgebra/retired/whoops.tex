Niccol\`{o} Fontana Tartaglia was a great mathematician of the
1500's. Once he claimed claimed that the sums
\[
1+2+4, \qquad 1+2+4+8, \qquad 1+2+4+8+16, \qquad\text{and so on,} 
\]
are alternately prime and composite.

\begin{prob}
Investigate Tartaglia's claim and report your findings.
\end{prob}

One thing that would make analyzing this claim easier would be if we
had a simple formula for his sums. 

\begin{prob} 
Using a table, see if you can guess a formula for Tartaglia's sums.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
Can you explain why your formula holds? Can you generalize your
formula?
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
Expand out the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(a^2 -1)(1 + a^2 + a^{2 \cdot 2})$
\item $(a^2 -1)(1 + a^2 + a^{2 \cdot 2}+a^{3 \cdot 2})$  
\item $(a^2 -1)(1 + a^2 + a^{2 \cdot 2}+a^{3 \cdot 2} + a^{4 \cdot 2})$ 
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} Expand out the following:
\[
(2^a - 1)(1 + 2^a + 2^{2a} + 2^{3a} + \dots + 2^{(b-1)a})
\]
what does this say about Tartaglia's conjecture above?
\end{prob}
