\begin{prob}
Sum the numbers:
\[
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + \dots + 8388608
\]
\end{prob}



\begin{prob}
Billy the Bouncing Ball is dropped from a height of 13.5 feet.  After
each bounce, Billy only goes up by $60\%$ of what he did on the
previous bounce.

\begin{enumerate}
\item How high will Billy go after the 38th bounce?
\item How much distance will Billy travel over the course of 38
  bounces (not including the height he went up after the 38th
  bounce)?
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Assume now that Billy the Bouncing Ball is dropped from a height of
$h$ feet. After each bounce, Billy goes up a distance equal to $r$
times the distance of the previous bounce. (For example, $r=.60$ in
part 1.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $r<1$, what can you say about Billy's bounces? What if $r=1$?
  What if $r>1$?
\item How high will Billy go after the $k$th bounce?
\item How much distance will Billy travel over the course of $k$
  bounces (not including the height he went up after the $k$th
  bounce)?
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}
