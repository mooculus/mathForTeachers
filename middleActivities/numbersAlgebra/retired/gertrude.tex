\section{Gertrude the Gumchewer}

\begin{prob}\label{P:gtg1}
Gertrude the Gumchewer has an addiction to \textit{Xtra Sugarloaded
  Gum}, and it's getting worse.  Each day, she goes to her always
stocked storage vault and grabs gum to chew.  At the beginning of her
habit, she chewed three pieces and then, each day, she chews 8 more
pieces than she chewed the day before to satisfy her ever-increasing
cravings.
\begin{enumerate}
\item How many pieces will she chew on the $10$th day of her habit?
\item How many pieces will she chew on the $k$th day of her habit?
\item How many pieces will she chew on the $793$rd day of her habit? How do you know you are right?
\item How many pieces will she chew over the course of the first $793$
  days of her habit?
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}\label{P:gtg2}
Assume now that Gertrude, at the beginning of her habit, chewed $m$
pieces of gum and then, each day, she chews $n$ more pieces than she
chewed the day before to satisfy her ever-increasing cravings.  How many pieces will she chew over the course of the first $k$
  days of her habit? Explain your formula and how you know it will work for any $m$, $n$ and $k$.  
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Use the method you developed in questions \ref{P:gtg1} and
\ref{P:gtg2} to find the sum:
\[
19 + 26 + 33 + \dots + 1720
\]
Give a story problem that is represented by this sum.
\end{prob}
