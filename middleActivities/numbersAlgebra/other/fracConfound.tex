Oscar wanted to model
\[
\frac{1}{3}\div \frac{2}{5}
\]
with pictures. To do so, he drew
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/fracConf1.pdf}
\]
Then he drew:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/fracConf2.pdf}
\]
At this point there are a number of questions:

\begin{prob} 
Based on the picture, what was Oscar's final numerical answer?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Is Oscar's answer correct? If so, then explain why; if not, explain
why not.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} How would you model
\[
\frac{1}{3}\div \frac{2}{5}
\]
with pictures?
\end{prob}
