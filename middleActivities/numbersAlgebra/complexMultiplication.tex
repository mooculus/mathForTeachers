\section{Geometry and Multiplying Complex Numbers}\label{A:complexMultiplication}

Now we'll investigate the geometry of multiplying complex
numbers. In each case, specify the transformation.  For example, if you see a rotation, specify the angle and the center of rotation.  

Louie Llama\index{Louie Llama} is here to help us out:

\begin{prob} 
Here's Louie Llama hanging out near the point $0$ in the complex
plane. Multiply him by $2$. Make a table and show in the plane below what happens.  What transformation do you see?

\begin{prob} 
Now multiply him by $i$. Make a table and show in the plane below what happens.  What transformation do you see?  
\[

\begin{prob} 
Now multiply Louie Llama by $1+i$. Make a table and show in the plane
below what happens.  What transformation do you see?

\begin{prob} 
%  Used to mutliply by $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$.
Now multiply Louie Llama by $1 - 2i$. Make a
table and show in the plane below what happens.  What transformation do you see?

\begin{prob}
Make a table to summarize your results from the previous problems.  
Then describe what happens geometrically when we ``multiply''  by a complex
number.
