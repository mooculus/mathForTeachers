\section{Lumpy and Eddie}

Two ancient philosophers, Lumpy and Eddie, were sitting on rocks
flipping coins. 

\begin{prob} Lumpy and Eddie wondered about the probability of obtaining both a head and a tail. Here is how it went:
\begin{quote}
Eddie argued the following: ``Look Lumpy, it's clear to me that when
we flip two coins, we should get one of each about half the time
because there are two possibilities: They're either the same or
different.'' Lumpy, on the other hand, argued this way: ``Eddie, stop
being a wise guy! If we flipped two coins, we should expect both a
head and tail to come up about a third of the time because there are
only three possibilities: two heads, two tails, and one of each.''
\end{quote}
Which, if any, of these two guys is right?  Is there another answer?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Next Lumpy and Eddie threw a third coin in the mix and wondered about
the probability of obtaining 2 heads and a tail or 2 tails and a head.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What would Lumpy say in this case?
\item What would Eddie say in this case?
\end{enumerate}
Be sure to clearly explain why you think they would answer in the way
you suggest.
\end{prob}
