\begin{problem} 
Draw pictures that model:
\[
\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}
\]
Explain how your pictures show this. Write a story problem whose
solution is given by the expression above.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} 
Draw pictures that model:
\[
\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{11}{12}
\]
Explain how your pictures model this equation. Be sure to carefully
explain how common denominators are represented in your
pictures. Write a story problem whose solution is given by the
expression above.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} 
Given $0<a\le b$ and $0<c\le d$, explain how to draw pictures
that model the sum:
\[
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d}
\]
Use pictures to find this sum and carefully explain how common
denominators are represented in your pictures.
\end{problem}

% The following problems have been replaced by a new activity about fraction multiplication
%
%\begin{problem} 
%Given positive integers $a$ and $b$, explain how to draw pictures that
%model the product $a\cdot b$---give an example of your process.
%\end{problem}
%
%\begin{problem} 
%Draw pictures that model:
%\[
%\frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{15}
%\]
%Explain how your pictures model this equation. Write a story problem
%whose solution is given by the expression above. Does your story work with 
%\[
%\frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{14}{15}?
%\]
