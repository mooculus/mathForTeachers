\begin{problem}  
\textit{Incognito's Hall of Shoes} is a shoe store that just
  opened in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. At the moment, they have 100
  pairs of shoes in stock. At their grand opening 100 customers showed
  up. The first customer tried on every pair of shoes, the second
  customer tried on every 2nd pair, the third customer tried on every
  3rd pair, and so on until the 100th customer, who only tried on the
  last pair of shoes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Which shoes were tried on by only 1 customer?
\item Which shoes were tried on by exactly 2 customers?
\item Which shoes were tried on by exactly 3 customers?
\item Which shoes were tried on by exactly 4 customers?
\item How many customers tried on the 45th pair?  
\item How many customers tried on the 81st pair?  
\item Challenge:  Which shoes were tried on by the most customers?  
\end{enumerate}
In each case, explain your reasoning.
