Lothar is recording the number of goats he owns.  His recording looks like this.
\[
\includegraphics[height=0.75in]{lothar_goats.png}
\]
Lothar's wife, Gertrude, uses the following symbols to record things.
\[
\includegraphics[height=0.4in]{gerturde_symbols.png}
\]
Gertrude writes the number of Lothar's goats as
\[
\includegraphics[height=0.4in]{gertrude_goats.png}
\]
In case it's helpful information, Gertrude would also write 5 goats as
\[
\includegraphics[height=0.4in]{gertrude_ex.png}
\]
Now answer the following questions about Gertrude's system.
\begin{problem}
If Lothar lost a goat, how would Gertrude write this new number of goats? 
\vfill
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
If Lothar bought another goat (from the original number), how would Gertrude write this new number of goats? 
\vfill
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
If we would write the number of goats as 37, how would Gertrude write the number of goats?
\vfill
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
Explain the rules for Gertrude's counting system.  Write out a few (large) numbers in order as an example to show that you understand.

The aliens living on Omnicron Persei 8 keep track of how many humans they have eaten in the last week.  One such alien, Lrrr, tallies the number of humans he has eaten with this picture.
\[
\includegraphics[height=0.75in]{omnicron_ate.png}
\]
His wife, Ndnd, uses the following symbols to write quantities.
\[
\includegraphics[height=0.4in]{omnicron_symbols.png}
\]
She writes the number of humans that Lrrr ate as follows.
\[
\includegraphics[height=0.4in]{omnicron_ate_again.png}
\]

\begin{problem}
If Lrrr ate another human, how would Ndnd write this new number of humans? 
\vfill
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
If one of the humans actually escaped from the original number (and therefore was not eaten by Lrrr), how would Ndnd write this new number of humans? 
\vfill
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
If we would write the number of humans as 101, how would Ndnd write this number?
\vfill
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
Explain the rules for Ndnd's counting system.  Write out a few (large) numbers in order as an example to show that you understand.
