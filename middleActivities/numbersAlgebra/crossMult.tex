\begin{prob} 
What might someone call the following statements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\dfrac{a}{b} = \dfrac{c}{d} \Rightarrow ad = bc$
\item $\dfrac{a}{b}\cdot \dfrac{b}{c} = \dfrac{a}{c}$
\item $\dfrac{a}{b}\div \dfrac{c}{d} = \dfrac{ad}{bc}$
\item $\dfrac{a}{b} +\dfrac{c}{d} = \dfrac{ad+bc}{bd}$
\item $ad < bc \Rightarrow \dfrac{a}{b} < \dfrac{c}{d}$
\item $ad < bc \Rightarrow \dfrac{c}{d} < \dfrac{a}{b}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Which of the above statements are true? What specific name might you
use to describe them?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
Use pictures to help explain why the true statements above are true
and give counterexamples showing that the false statements are false.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob} 
Can you think of other statements that should be grouped with those
above?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
If mathematics is a subject where you should strive to ``say what you
mean and mean what you say,'' what issue might arise with
cross-multiplication?
\end{prob}
