\begin{teachingnote}
Perhaps ask students to come up with the sequence of transformations. Suggest patty paper to help.  

Discuss a common error:   Translate $\triangle ABC$ through the vector $\overrightarrow{BY}$.  Then rotate about $Y$ by $\angle C'YZ.$. 

The generality of the proofs requires consideration of the possibility that a reflection might not be necessary in the general case.  Use half-plane ideas to ask whether points are on the same side or opposite sides of lines, and reflect if they are on opposite sides.  

Simplify by eliminating the prime notation.  After the translation, for example, $A$ coincides with $X$.  (See photos from class.)

In this activity, we show how the common triangle congruence criteria follow from
 what we now know about rigid motions.\margincomment{CCSS G-CO.8.  Explain how the criteria for triangle congruence (ASA, SAS, and
  SSS) follow from the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions.}  
 Recall that two figures are said to be 
\emph{congruent} if there exists a basic rigid motion (translation, rotation, or reflection) or a 
sequence of basic rigid motions that maps one figure onto the other.  

\begin{problem}
Proof of Side-Angle-Side (SAS) congruence.  Suppose $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle XYZ$ are such that $AB=XY$, $AC=XZ$, and $\angle A \cong \angle X$.  Prove, using basic rigid motions, that $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle XYZ$.  Consider the figure below.  
\begin{image}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{SAS.pdf}
\end{image}
Fill in the details of the following proof.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Translate $\triangle ABC$ through the vector $\overrightarrow{AX}$.  Call the image $\triangle A'B'C'$.  Explain why $A'$ and $X$ coincide. 

\begin{teachingnote}
This is pretty obvious, but it helps to say it:  Move $A$ through 
the vector $\overrightarrow{AX}$ and it will be at $X$.  
\end{teachingnote}
\vspace{1in}
\item Rotate $\triangle A'B'C'$ about $X=A'$ through $\angle B'XY$ so that ray $\overrightarrow{A'B'}$ is along ray $\overrightarrow{XY}$.  Call the image $\triangle A''B''C''$   Explain how you know the segments $\overline{A''B''}$ and $\overline{XY}$ coincide. 
\vspace{1in}
\item Reflect $\triangle A''B''C''$ about the line $\overleftrightarrow{A''B''} = \overleftrightarrow{XY}$.  Call the image $\triangle A'''B'''C'''$.  Explain why $\overline{A'''C'''}$ and $\overline{XZ}$ coincide.
\vspace{1in}
\item Explain how you now know that all sides and angles of $\triangle A'''B'''C'''$ are congruent to the corresponding sides and angles of $\triangle XYZ$.  
\vspace{1in}
\item Explain how to modify the above steps to handle the following different cases: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Initially $X = A$. 
\item After the translation, $\overline{A'B'}$ and $\overline{XY}$ coincide. 
\item After the rotation, $\overline{A''C''}$ and $\overline{XZ}$ coincide.  (Hint:  Consider whether $C''$ and $Z$ are on the same side or on opposite sides of $\overleftrightarrow{XZ}$.)  
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
Proof of Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) congruence.  Suppose $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle XYZ$ are such that $AB=XY$, $\angle A \cong \angle X$, and $\angle B \cong \angle Y$.  Prove, using basic rigid motions, that $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle XYZ$.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Outline a general proof for the figure below.  
\begin{image}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{ASA.pdf}
\end{image}
\item Explain carefully how you know, after the sequence of rigid motions, that the ``final image'' of $C$ coincides with $Z$.  
\item Describe how to modify the outline to handle other cases. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
In a previous activity, you used triangle congruence criteria to prove the following results: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The Isosceles Triangle Theorem.
\item The points on a perpendicular bisector of a segment are exactly those that are equidistant from the endpoints.
\end{itemize}
Verify that these results could have been established using only SAS and ASA congruence.  (Thus, you may use these results in the problems that follow.)

\begin{problem}
Proof of Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) congruence.  Suppose $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle XYZ$ are such that $\angle C$ and $\angle Z$ are right angles, $AB=XY$, and $BC=YZ$.  Prove that $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle XYZ$.  
\begin{image}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{HL.pdf}
\end{image}
\vfill
\end{problem}

\begin{teachingnote}
One approach:  First extend side $\overrightarrow{AC}$ to a point $A'$ so that $CA'=XZ$, and argue that $\triangle A'BC \cong \triangle XYZ$.

Easier:  Translate $\triangle ABC$ through the vector $\overrightarrow{CZ}$.  Then rotate.

Alternatively, save HL until after SSS?
\end{teachingnote}

\begin{problem}
Proof of Side-Side-Side (SSS) congruence.  Suppose $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle XYZ$ are such that $AB=XY$, $AC=XZ$, and $BC=YZ$.  Prove, using basic rigid motions, that $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle XYZ$.  Build toward the general case through the following steps:  
\begin{teachingnote}
Or maybe these two figures don't matter if we emphasize that $A$ and $B$ both lie on the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{CZ}$.  

Marking the diagrams is helpful.
\end{teachingnote}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Case 1a:  $A=X$, $B=Y$, and $C$ and $Z$ lie on opposite sides of $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$.  (Hint:  Explain why the situation must be like one of the figures below, argue that $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{CZ}$, and then use a reflection.)
\begin{image}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{SSS.pdf}
\end{image}
\item Case 1b:  $A=X$, $B=Y$, and $C$ and $Z$ lie on the same side of $\overleftrightarrow{AB}=\overleftrightarrow{XY}$.  (Hint: Consider a reflection of one of the triangles and use the previous case.)  
\item Case 2:  $A=X$ but $B \ne Y$.
\item Case 3: The general case.  
\end{enumerate}
