Informally, a \emph{transformation} of the plane is a ``motion,'' such
as a rotation or a stretch of the plane, that takes a figure to an
\emph{image} of that figure.  This activity explores the basic rigid
motions: translations (slides), rotations (turns), and reflections
(flips).


\begin{problem}
One of the pairs of figures below shows a translation, and the other
pair does not.  To identify which is which, draw segments between each
point and its image.  Use those segments to explain your reasoning.

\begin{problem}
One of the pairs of figures shows a reflection about the given line, and the other pair does not.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify which pair of figures shows a reflection about the given line, and explain how you know. 
\item Find the line of reflection for the other pair of figures, and explain your reasoning.

\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\newpage
\begin{problem}
One of the pairs of figures below shows a rotation about point $C$, and the other pair does not. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify which pair of figures shows a rotation about $C$, and explain how you know.  
\item Find the angle of rotation.  
\item Find the center of and angle of rotation for the other pair of figures.  Explain your reasoning.

\newpage
\begin{problem}
Two figures are said to be \emph{congruent} if there is a sequence of basic rigid motions that take one figure onto the other.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Specify a sequence of two or three basic rigid motions that takes one F onto the other.  Illustrate intermediate images.  Explain your reasoning.

\item Explain briefly why, for this pair of figures, sequences of the following types cannot work: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a rotation followed by a rotation
\item a translation followed by a translation
\item a reflection followed by a reflection
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
