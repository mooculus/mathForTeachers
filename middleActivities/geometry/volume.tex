In this activity, we will investigate formulas for area and
volume.


\begin{problem}
Explain how the following picture ``proves'' that the area of a right
  triangle is one half of the base times the height.

\end{image}
\vfill
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
``Shearing'' is a process where you take a shape, cut it into thin parallel strips, 
and then move the strips in a direction parallel to the strips to make a new shape.  
By Cavalieri's principle:\index{Cavalieri's principle}
\begin{quote}
Shearing parallel to a fixed direction does not change the $n$-dimensional measure of an object.
\end{quote}
What is this saying?

\end{problem}

\newpage

\begin{problem}
Building on the first two problems, explain how the following picture
  ``proves'' that the area of any triangle is one half of the base times the
  height.
\begin{image}
\includegraphics{pbpShearTri.pdf}
\end{image}
\vfill
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Explain how to use a picture to ``prove'' that a triangle of a given
  area could have an arbitrarily large perimeter.
\vfill
\end{problem}

\newpage

\begin{problem}
Shearing is a special case of Cavalieri's principle, which, in two dimensions, is stated as follows:  
\begin{quote}
Suppose two regions in a plane are contained between two parallel lines.  If every line parallel to the given lines intersects the two regions in equal lengths, then the regions have equal area.  
\end{quote}
Give an intuitive argument explaining why Cavalieri's principle is true.

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
State Cavalieri's principle in three dimensions.

%\begin{problem}
%Sketch a net for a right pyramid of height $2''$ with a $2'' \times
%2''$ square base. Share your sketch with your neighbor---does it look
%OK?
%\end{problem}
%

%\begin{problem}
%Give detailed diagrams that show that a cube can be constructed from
%three equal pyramids.
%\end{problem}
\newpage

\begin{problem}
Cut out the provided net.  Then fold it and tape it to create a square-based pyramid.  With your neighbors, show that three such square-based pyramids can form a cube.  
\begin{image}
\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{rightPyramid}
\end{image}
\end{problem}

\newpage
\begin{problem}
Use your work above to derive a formula for the volume of a
right pyramid with a square base. The formula should be in terms of
the side length of the square base.
\vfill
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Use Cavalieri's principle to explain the formula for \textbf{every} pyramid with an $s\times s$ square base of height $s$ in terms of $s$.  Be sure to describe how this formula is different from the previous one.  
\vfill
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Provide an informal explanation of a volume formula for any pyramid-like object with a base of area $B$ and height $h$.  Be sure to describe what you mean by ``pyramid-like'' and whether your formula works for a cone.

Think of $r$ as fixed, and think of $x$ as the varying height of a cross section of both figures.  The $s$ is the radius of the cross-section of the sphere.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item The sphere, cylinder, and cone should all have the same ``height.''  What should that height be?  Explain why this is necessary.  
\item The shaded cross section of the cylinder minus the cone is called an ``annulus'' (or washer).  Explain why its inner radius, marked with $?$, is the same as $x$. 
\item Draw and label an ``aerial view'' of the cross sections.   Explain why the cross-sections at height $x$ have the same area.  
\item State a three-dimensional version of Cavalieri's principle.  
\item Use Cavalieri's principle to and the formulas for the volume of a cylinder and the volume of a cone to derive a formula for the volume of a sphere of radius $r$.
