\begin{teachingnote}
It might help give students some concrete sets to try first.  On the Internet there are nice pictures of the four-set situation. Students are likely to see connections to the traffic lights problem from \emph{Numbers and Algebra}.

\begin{problem} 
Draw a Venn diagram with one set. List every possible relationship
between an element and this set. 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} 
Draw a Venn diagram with two intersecting sets. List every possible
relationship between an element and these sets.
\end{problem}


\begin{problem} 
Draw a Venn diagram with three intersecting sets. List every possible
relationship between an element and these sets.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Describe and explain any patterns you see occurring.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{P:AVD}
Draw a Venn diagram with four intersecting sets. List every possible
relationship between an element and these sets.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Are you \textbf{sure} that your diagram for Problem~\ref{P:AVD} is
correct? If so explain why. If not, draw a correct Venn diagram.
