In this activity we are going to investigate \textit{midsets}.

\begin{definition}\index{midset}
Given two points $A$ and $B$, their \textbf{midset} is the set of points that are an equal distance away from both $A$ and $B$.
\end{definition}

\begin{problem} 
Draw two points in the plane $A$ and $B$. See if you can sketch the
Euclidean midset of these two points.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
See if you can use coordinate constructions to find the equation of
the midset of two points $A$ and $B$. If necessary, set $A = (2,3)$
and $B = (5,7)$.
\end{problem}

\newpage
\begin{teachingnote}
Use specific pairs of points and smaller grids.  Bring extra grids.
\end{teachingnote}  
\begin{problem}
Now working in city geometry, place two points and see if you can find
their midset.

\begin{problem}
Let's try to classify the various midsets in city geometry:
