\begin{problem}


Develop slope-slope form of a line as an equation that must be true for $(x,y)$ to be on the line through $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$.Â  

Write and equation of the line through $(2,3)$ and $(6,8)$.  Then generalize

\[
\frac{y-8}{x-6} = \frac{8-3}{6-2}
\]

\[
\frac{y-y_2}{x-x_2} = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
\]


Discuss how slope-slope form can be easily converted to point-slope form and to a form $y =$ ``something equivalent $mx + b$'' as follow: 

\[
y-y_2 =\left(\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\right) (x-x_2)
\]
\[
y =y_2 + \left(\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\right) (x-x_2)
\]

Have some conversation about how to check whether a point is on the line.  

Write the equation of the line through

\begin{problem}
Draw a graph of the line $3x+5y=12$.  
\end{problem}

\begin{teachingnote}
Most students will translate to slope-intercept form and use it to plot the $y$-intercept and a few other points.  We hope that a few students will observe that two points are sufficient to determine a line, and the easiest points to compute are the $x$- and $y$-intercepts.  
\end{teachingnote}


\begin{problem}
Let your birth month, $m$,  and your birth day, $d$, be coordinates of a point in the plane $(m,d)$.  Write an equation of line parallel to $3x+5y=12$ and containing $(m,d)$.  Write the equation in standard form. 

\begin{teachingnote}
Most students will translate to slope-intercept form, use the same slope, do quite a bit of 
algebra to find $b$ in $y=mx+b$, and finally translate back to standard form.
