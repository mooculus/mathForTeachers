\begin{instructorIntro}
Here, we reiterate their experience with $f$ and $f'$, but now we do it graphically (essentially letting them find the derivative before doing it numerically/algebraically).  It is here that they first recognize that we are finding the slope and treating $f'$ as the slope function (whose $y$-values are rates and not amounts- a difficult hurdle to overcome).  

They also, going deeper, will begin to recognize that when the function is increasing (decreasing), $f'$ is above (below) the $x$-axis and when $f$ is at a max or min value, $f'$ is $0$ ($x$-intercept of $f'$ graph.  We do mention cusps, where $f'$ is undefined, but don't dwell on them very much in the course).  They may even want to make a sign chart for $f'$ at this point.

A nice expansion of this activity would be for the students to draw their own functions and have their peers graph the derivatives.

\begin{question} 
In the gondola of a hot air balloon, two instruments monitor the balloon's course over the course of a $6$-minute period.  An altimeter shows the balloonâ€™s height and a rate-of-climb meter shows how fast the balloon rises or falls.  Here are the resultant graphs (Heights change a lot due to updrafts and downdrafts).

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find when the balloon is going up (height increasing) and going down (height decreasing).  Look at each graph separately to answer the question.
\item 	At what time is the velocity of the balloon zero?  What is happening to the balloon at those times? Look at each graph separately to answer the question.
\item	Use the second graph to answer when the balloon is rising the fastest and when it is falling the fastest.  What does the first graph do at those times?
