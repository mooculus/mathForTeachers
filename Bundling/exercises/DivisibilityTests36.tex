\begin{question}
We want to find a fast way to decide if a large number, say $N$, is divisible by 36.  Which of the following would work as a divisibility test for 36?  Mark all of the following that are correct.

\begin{selectAll}

\choice {We can check whether $N$ is divisible by 36 by checking whether $N$ is divisible by 6 because $36 = 6 \times 6$.}
\choice[correct]{We can check whether $N$ is divisible by 36 by checking whether $N$ is divisible by 4 and by 9 because $36 = 4 \times 9$.}
\choice {We can check whether $N$ is divisible by 36 by checking whether $N$ is divisible by 3 and by 12 because $36 = 3 \times 12$.}
\choice {We can check whether $N$ is divisible by 36 by checking whether $N$ is divisible by 2 and by 18 because $36 = 2 \times 18$.}


\end{selectAll}



\end{question}
