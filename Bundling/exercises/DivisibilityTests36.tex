\begin{question}
We want to find a fast way to decide if a large number, say $N$, is divisible by 36.  Which of the following would work as a divisibility test for 36?  

\begin{selectAll}

\choice {We can check whether $N$ is divisible by 36 by checking whether $N$ is divisible by 6.  This is because $36 = 6 \times 6$.}
\choice[correct]{We can check whether $N$ is divisible by 36 by checking whether $N$ is divisible by 4 and by 9.  This is because $36 = 4 \times 9$ and 4 and 9 have no common factors.}
\choice {We can check whether $N$ is divisible by 36 by checking whether $N$ is divisible by 3 and by 12.  This is because $36 = 3 \times 12$ and 3 is prime.}
\choice {We can check whether $N$ is divisible by 36 by checking whether $N$ is divisible by 2 and by 18.  This is because $36 = 2 \times 18$ and 2 is prime.}


\end{selectAll}
