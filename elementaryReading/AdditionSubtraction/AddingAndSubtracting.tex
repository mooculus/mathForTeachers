\section{Addition}

Let's start by going back to the previous question and see if we can identify why it's solved with addition.

\begin{explanation}
Alastair has $5$ pencils in his pencil box, and Blake has $8$ pencils in her pencil box. We are trying to see how many pencils they have all together. We'll start by drawing a picture using beads to represent this situation.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	 \foreach \x/\y in {
    0/0, 2/2, 3/0.2, 0.3/1.2, 4/2
  } {
    \draw[fill=orange] (\x, \y) circle (4pt);}
   	\draw[thick] (2, 1) ellipse (3cm and 2cm);
	\node[below] at (2, -1) {Alastair's pencils};

	 \foreach \x/\y in {
    6/1, 8/2, 7/0, 6.5/1.5, 9/0, 8/0.5, 7.25/1.5, 9.25/1.5
  } {
    \draw[fill=lightgray] (\x, \y) circle (4pt);}
   	\draw[thick] (8, 1) ellipse (2.5cm and 1.75cm);
	\node[below] at (8, -1) {Blake's pencils};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The problem is asking us how many pencils Alastair and Blake have all together, so let's put their pencils all together in a pile and count how many pencils there are in total. We'll show the pencils being put together with some arrows.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	 \foreach \x/\y in {
    0/0, 2/2, 3/0.2, 0.3/1.2, 4/2
  } {
    \draw[fill=orange] (\x, \y) circle (4pt);}
   	\draw[thick] (2, 1) ellipse (3cm and 2cm);
	\node[below] at (2, -1) {Alastair's pencils};

	 \foreach \x/\y in {
    6/1, 8/2, 7/0, 6.5/1.5, 9/0, 8/0.5, 7.25/1.5, 9.25/1.5
  } {
    \draw[fill=lightgray] (\x, \y) circle (4pt);}
   	\draw[thick] (8, 1) ellipse (2.5cm and 1.75cm);
	\node[below] at (8, -1) {Blake's pencils};

\draw[thick, ->] (2, -1.5)--(3, -3.5);
\draw[thick, ->] (8, -1.5)--(6, -3.5);
 \foreach \x/\y in {
    3/-4.5, 2.5/-3.75, 4/-3.8, 3.3/-5.2, 4.5/-5
  } {
    \draw[fill=orange] (\x, \y) circle (4pt);}
	
 \foreach \x/\y in {
    7/-5, 6/-4, 5/-4, 4.5/-3.5, 7/-4, 6/-4.5, 5.25/-5.5, 7.25/-3.5
  } {
    \draw[fill=lightgray] (\x, \y) circle (4pt);}

	\node[below] at (5, -6) {all of the pencils};


\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

We can count $\answer[given]{8}$ pencils in total.


\end{explanation}

What action did we take with the pencils (or with the beads that represented them)? We combined all of the pencils together and counted the total, because that's what the problem was asking us to do. When we find ourselves taking this action in order to solve a problem, we've used \dfn{addition}.

\begin{definition}
When we \dfn{add} two numbers $A$ and $B$ together, we combine the two quantities $A$ and $B$ and count the total. We write this total as $A+B$. Sometimes we use a different variable like $C$ to represent $A+B$ to remind us that the total is a single quantity. The two numbers $A$ and $B$ are called the \dfn{addends} and the total is also called the \dfn{sum}.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (0, 0) {$A$};
\node at (0.5, 0) {$+$};
\node at (1, 0) {$B$};
\node at (1.5, 0) {$=$};
\node at (2, 0) {$C$};
\node at (0.5, -1) {addends};
\node at (2, -1) {sum};
\draw[->] (0.5, -0.75)--(0, -0.25);
\draw[->] (0.5, -0.75)--(1, -0.25);
\draw[->] (2, -0.75)--(2, -0.25);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{definition}

One thing to pay attention to here is that $A+B$ means the total of all of the objects. We often think of $A+B$ as telling us to do something (perhaps to combine some things), but we want you to practice thinking about it more as the result than the process.

Another thing to notice is that we will often think of $A$ and $B$, the two addends, as the number of items in two different sets. When we add these two quantities, we are combining the sets together and finding out how many elements are in this combined set. Of course, we have to have no overlap between the original sets for this to work!

We want to be able to recognize this structure in lots of places. When children work on addition problems, they have lots of different strategies that they might use when working with blocks or other small objects, and we want children to be able to recognize addition in situations that can sometimes seem very different. 

For instance, the story we just solved might be considered a \dfn{put together} type story, because our main goal in the problem was to put together two different sets of objects and count the total. Another way to describe this type of problem is to call it a \dfn{part-part-whole} problem, because we are considering two separate parts as well as the whole we get by joining them together. 

But here is a different type of story problem.

\begin{question}
Carlos has $3$ pencils in his pencil box, and then his friend Darius gives him $4$ more pencils. How many pencils does Carlos have now?

\begin{explanation}
In this case, we want to start by drawing the pencils that Carlos has at the beginning of the story. We will represent the pencils with small circles, and we need to draw $\answer[given]{3}$ of them.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\foreach \x in {0, 0.5, 1} \draw[fill=yellow] (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Next, Darius gives Carlos $4$ more pencils. If we had actual blocks in front of us, we might set down more blocks next to the ones we already have, and then count the total. Let's add to our picture the $\answer[given]{4}$ pencils from Darius. We'll make them a different color only so that we can see which ones were the original ones and which ones are new.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\foreach \x in {0, 0.5, 1} \draw[fill=yellow] (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
	\foreach \x in {1.5, 2, 2.5, 3} \draw[fill=purple] (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Now we can count all of the circles that we have.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\foreach \x in {0, 0.5, 1} \draw[fill=yellow] (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
	\foreach \x in {1.5, 2, 2.5, 3} \draw[fill=purple] (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
	\node[below] at (0, -0.2) {$1$};
	\node[below] at (0.5, -0.2) {$2$};
	\node[below] at (1, -0.2) {$3$};
	\node[below] at (1.5, -0.2) {$4$};
	\node[below] at (2, -0.2) {$5$};
	\node[below] at (2.5, -0.2) {$6$};
	\node[below] at (3, -0.2) {$7$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
We see that Carlos now has $\answer[given]{7}$ pencils.

\end{explanation}
\end{question}

Now that we've solved this problem, let's make sure we used addition to solve it.

\begin{question}
What expression would we use to solve the following problem? \emph{Carlos has $3$ pencils in his pencil box, and then his friend Darius gives him $4$ more pencils. How many pencils does Carlos have now?}

\begin{explanation}
Look back at the picture we used to solve the original problem. We remember that the meaning of addition is to combine two quantities together and count the total. Is that what we did in our picture?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{Yes, we combined two quantities and counted the total.}
\choice{No, we did something else.}
\end{multipleChoice}

Since we did combine two quantities and count the total, we used addition to solve this problem. The expression that represents the total would then be $3 + \answer[given]{4}$ because we started with $3$ objects, combined that with $4$ more objects, and then the total would be represented by $3+4$.
\end{explanation}
\end{question}

In the previous problem, Carlos started with some pencils, and then over time his number of pencils was changing. The type of problem that occurs over time we might call a \dfn{change over time} problem. Other books call this a \dfn{join} problem, because we started with one set, and then joined another set to it, and then counted the result.

Let's compare the two problems that we have done to see that they are actually different. In the problem about Alastair and Blake, we started by drawing both Alastair's pencils and Blake's pencils, because all of the pencils were there at the start of the problem. In Carlos's problem we started by only drawing some of the pencils. These are different starting situations, and sometimes children could think that we are working on different operations because we started in different places. However, we want to point out that in the end, the action we took to find the answer was to combine the two quantities and count everything we had. That was the same in both situations.

Another difference we can see is that in Alastair and Blake's problem, we show the two sets being combined together with arrows. We might do this by moving the blocks around the table, or pushing the two sets of blocks together. In Carlos's problem, we set down some blocks and then set down some more blocks next to the first ones. We didn't really need to move the blocks around on the table. Again, we want to point out that even though we are putting the blocks in physically different locations, the underlying idea is still to combine the two sets together.

It's very important to keep in mind that there are different types of story problems for addition. We want children to see addition in lots of different contexts, and if we don't pay attention to the types of problems we are giving, we can very easily just give the same type of problem over and over again. Plus, children tend to understand things better when they can work from their own ideas. Having different ways to represent addition helps us to communicate to kids that addition is an operation that comes out of the ideas they have about putting things together, not just a rule we memorize when it comes to certain wording.

Speaking of wording, you might have been taught to use keywords in story problems to identify what operation to use. Please be cautious with this approach: it's very easy to write story problems that have keywords for one operation but are solved in a completely different way than you might expect! We really recommend trying not to pay as much attention to the specific wording of a problem as the actions you are taking when you draw simple pictures to solve these problems.

There is one other type of addition problem that we want to be able to solve, but it will be easier to talk about that type after we talk about subtraction. So, let's move on!


\section{Subtraction}


\begin{example}
Consider the following story problem. 

\emph{Blake is using $8$ different colored pencils to work on a drawing, but $5$ of her pencils actually belong to Alastair. How many pencils belong to Blake?}

We want to see how this is a subtraction story problem.

Let's start by drawing all $8$ pencils that Blake is using.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
 \foreach \x/\y in {
    3/4.5, 2.5/3.75, 4.5/5, 7/5, 5/4, 4.5/3.5, 6/4.5, 7.25/3.5
  } {
    \draw[fill=orange] (\x, \y) circle (4pt);}
    \node[below] at (5, 3.25) {all of the pencils};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

We know that not all of these pencils belong to Blake, however. There are $\answer[given]{5}$ of them that belong to Alastair. Let's separate out Alastair's pencils from the entire collection and draw a circle around them.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

 \foreach \x/\y in {
     3/4.5, 2.5/3.75, 4.5/5, 7/5, 5/4, 4.5/3.5, 6/4.5, 7.25/3.5
  } {
    \draw[fill=orange] (\x, \y) circle (4pt);}
    \node[below] at (5, 3.25) {all of the pencils};

	 \foreach \x/\y in {
    0/-2, 2/0, 3/-1.8, 0.3/-0.8, 4/-0.5
  } {
    \draw[fill=orange] (\x, \y) circle (4pt);}
   	\draw[thick] (2, -1) ellipse (3cm and 2cm);
	\node[below] at (2, -3) {Alastair's pencils};

	 \foreach \x/\y in {
    8/-1, 8.25/0, 8.5/-0.5
  } {
    \draw[fill=lightgray] (\x, \y) circle (4pt);}
   	\draw[thick] (8.25, -0.5) ellipse (1.5cm and 1cm);
	%\node[below] at (8, -1) {Blake's pencils};

\draw[thick, ->] (4.9, 2.5)--(3.5, 0.8);
\draw[thick, ->] (5.1, 2.5)--(7, 0.5);

\end{tikzpicture} \end{center}

The group of pencils that is not Alastair's must be Blake's, so we can label the other circle as Blake's pencils and then count how many pencils are in Blake's circle.


\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

 \foreach \x/\y in {
     3/4.5, 2.5/3.75, 4.5/5, 7/5, 5/4, 4.5/3.5, 6/4.5, 7.25/3.5
  } {
    \draw[fill=orange] (\x, \y) circle (4pt);}
    \node[below] at (5, 3.25) {all of the pencils};

	 \foreach \x/\y in {
    0/-2, 2/0, 3/-1.8, 0.3/-0.8, 4/-0.5
  } {
    \draw[fill=orange] (\x, \y) circle (4pt);}
   	\draw[thick] (2, -1) ellipse (3cm and 2cm);
	\node[below] at (2, -3) {Alastair's pencils};

	 \foreach \x/\y in {
    8/-1, 8.25/0, 8.5/-0.5
  } {
    \draw[fill=lightgray] (\x, \y) circle (4pt);}
   	\draw[thick] (8.25, -0.5) ellipse (1.5cm and 1cm);
	\node[below] at (8, -1.5) {Blake's pencils};

\draw[thick, ->] (4.9, 2.5)--(3.5, 0.8);
\draw[thick, ->] (5.1, 2.5)--(7, 0.5);

\end{tikzpicture} \end{center}

We count $\answer[given]{3}$ pencils in Blake's circle, and that's the answer to the original problem. 

We could also write the answer to this problem as $8-5$ because we started with $8$ pencils and we took away $5$ pencils from that collection, then we counted the leftovers.

\end{example}

The previous example gives us a good example of a definition of subtraction that we can use.

\begin{definition}
When we \dfn{subtract} two numbers, we take the quantity $B$ away from the quantity $A$ and then count the remaining objects. We write this total as $A - B$. If we write the total using a single variable $C$ to remind ourselves that this is a single quantity, then we can use the terminology \dfn{difference} to describe the total $C$. We can also call $A$, the starting number, the \dfn{minuend} and $B$, the number we subtracted, the \dfn{subtrahend}.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (0, 0) {$A$};
\node at (0.5, 0) {$-$};
\node at (1, 0) {$B$};
\node at (1.5, 0) {$=$};
\node at (2, 0) {$C$};
\node at (-0.75, -1) {minuend};
\node at (1,-1) {subtrahend};
\node at (2.75, -1) {difference};
\draw[->] (-0.75, -0.75)--(0, -0.25);
\draw[->] (1, -0.75)--(1, -0.25);
\draw[->] (2.75, -0.75)--(2, -0.25);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{definition}

Similarly to how we think about $A+B$ as meaning the total number of objects, we want to think about $A-B$ as the number of leftover objects. So while we got this number by working with the two separate numbers $A$ and $B$, the quantity $A-B$ is a single number. 

We also frequently will work with sets when we subtract. In this case, we are often thinking about starting with one set and removing part of that set when we subtract. Then the minuend would be how many elements are in the starting set, the subtrahend would be the number of elements we want to remove, and the difference would be the number of elements that remain after taking away.

Also, the problem we just solved could be called a \dfn{take apart} story, which is the analog of our put together type. We also called this type a part-part-whole story. We have all of the objects with us at the beginning of the problem, and we are simply rearranging them in order to solve the problem at hand.  Another way to think about this type of problem is that we are investigating the relationships between various parts of the problem, and we are not changing them over time.  It's a good time to contrast this type with a problem where we do have a change over time.

\begin{example}
Consider the following story problem.

\emph{Carlos has $4$ pencils in his pencil box, and then he gives away $3$ of his pencils to his friend Darius. How many pencils does Carlos have now?}

We want to see that this is a subtraction story problem that involves change over time.

Let's start by drawing all $4$ of Carlos's pencils, using small circles to represent the pencils.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5} \draw[fill=yellow] (\x, 0) circle (4pt);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Next, Carlos gives away $\answer[given]{3}$ of his pencils. Let's cross out the pencils that Carlos gives away.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5} \draw[fill=yellow] (\x, 0) circle (4pt);
\foreach \a in {0, 0.5, 1} \node at (\a, 0) {\huge $\times$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Finally, we count the pencils that Carlos still has, and we see the answer to this question is $\answer[given]{1}$.

We could also write the answer to this problem using the expression $4-3$ because we started with $4$ objects and then took away $3$ objects. The meaning of $A-B$ is how many objects are left when we take away $B$ objects from $A$ objects, so this fits our definition of subtraction.

We also notice that this problem happens over time: Carlos starts with $4$ pencils, and then some time later he has a different number of pencils. So our solution fits with the pattern of a change over time problem.

\end{example}

Change over time problems that are also subtraction problems are also sometimes called \dfn{separate} problems. We want you to recognize this language when you see it in other courses or teachers' resources, but our main point right now is again that we want to be able to give children different kinds of problems to work from, and we want to be able to use different types of representations in order to be able to build the idea of subtraction from what children are naturally doing when they model problems with blocks or other objects.

We used Alastair and Blake in both of the part-part-whole problems and we used Carlos and Darius in both of the change over time problems in order to help you to see that the type of story problem is independent of the operation we are using to solve the problem. We can have addition or subtraction versions of either of these types. There is one other type we would like to work through, where our main goal is to compare two sets. We will call this type a \dfn{comparison} story.

\begin{example}
Consider the following story problem.

\emph{Elphaba is playing with $6$ blocks while her friend Flynn is playing with $9$ blocks. How many more blocks is Flynn playing with than Elphaba?}

We want to solve this story problem with a picture, and discuss what operation we used to solve the problem. We'll actually do this in two different ways.

Before we get started, notice that this story is asking us to compare the blocks that Elphaba is playing with and the blocks that Flynn is playing with. This story is a comparison story, because the main goal is to compare these two sets. How might we solve this story with a picture?

Here is our first idea. Let's draw Elphaba's blocks in a horizontal line using small circles to represent the blocks, and then we'll draw Flynn's blocks in another horizontal line, but we'll line up the blocks vertically like we are using a one-to-one correspondence.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (0,0) {Elphaba's blocks: };
\foreach \x in {2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5} \draw[fill=pink] (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
\node at (0, -1) {Flynn's blocks: };
\foreach \x in {2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6} \draw[fill=red] (\x, -1) circle (3pt);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Since we are thinking about a one-to-one correspondence, let's cross out the blocks that both girls have in common. We'll do this in our picture with horizontal lines through the ones that match up. Those are blocks that we don't want to count for our answer, so we want to take them away from our picture. (We won't actually remove them, but the lines through them will indicate taking them away.)

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (0,0) {Elphaba's blocks: };
\foreach \x in {2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5} \draw[fill=pink] (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
\node at (0, -1) {Flynn's blocks: };
\foreach \x in {2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6} \draw[fill=red] (\x, -1) circle (3pt);
\foreach \x in {2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5} \draw[thick] (\x, -1.5)--(\x, 0.5);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The blocks that are not crossed off are the ones that Flynn has that Elphaba doesn't have, so these are the ones we want to count in order to solve this problem. We can circle them in our diagram, and then count and see that Flynn has $\answer[given]{3}$ extra blocks.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (0,0) {Elphaba's blocks: };
\foreach \x in {2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5} \draw[fill=pink] (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
\node at (0, -1) {Flynn's blocks: };
\foreach \x in {2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6} \draw[fill=red] (\x, -1) circle (3pt);
\foreach \x in {2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5} \draw[thick] (\x, -1.5)--(\x, 0.5);
\draw[thick] (5.5,-1) ellipse (0.75cm and 0.5cm);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

What expression might we write to describe our solution? Let's start with our operation. Here we will choose \wordChoice{\choice{addition} \choice[correct]{subtraction}} because the main action we took while solving this problem was \wordChoice{\choice{combining} \choice[correct]{taking away}}. In that case, our expression for the solution would be $9 - 6$ , because in a sense we started with the $9$ blocks that Flynn had, and removed the $6$ blocks that Elphaba had.

But this isn't the only way that children might solve the problem above. Let's redraw our starting picture and then attack the problem using different thinking. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (0,0) {Elphaba's blocks: };
\foreach \x in {2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5} \draw[fill=pink] (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
\node at (0, -1) {Flynn's blocks: };
\foreach \x in {2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6} \draw[fill=red] (\x, -1) circle (3pt);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

This time, instead of crossing out the blocks, let's think about what we might need to add to Elphaba's blocks in order to make them match with Flynn's blocks. We'll draw one unshaded circle for each block we add, and we'll count them as we go by labeling them with numbers.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (0,0) {Elphaba's blocks: };
\foreach \x in {2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5} \draw[fill=pink] (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
\foreach \a in {5, 5.5, 6} \draw (\a, 0) circle (3pt);
\node[above] at (5, 0.1) {$1$};
\node[above] at (5.5, 0.1) {$2$};
\node[above] at (6, 0.1) {$3$};
\node at (0, -1) {Flynn's blocks: };
\foreach \x in {2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6} \draw[fill=red] (\x, -1) circle (3pt);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The number of extra blocks that we had to put down to make the two lines of blocks equal was $\answer[given]{3}$, so that's (still) the answer to this problem.

What expression might we write to describe this second solution?  Here we used \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{addition} \choice{subtraction}} because the main action we took while solving this problem was \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{combining} \choice{taking away}}. Notice that in this example, we are putting down more blocks to solve this problem instead of removing them. If we wanted to describe this solution with an expression, we might actually use an equation this time: we solved this problem using $6 + ? = 9$. We started with the $6$ blocks that belonged to Elphaba, and we added blocks on. We didn't know how many blocks we were going to add when we started, so we use a question mark for the second number. But we do know that we need to end up with a total of $9$ blocks.


\end{example} 

You might be a little less comfortable with the idea of a question mark in the middle of an addition expression, but we hope that at the same time you can see that when kids are figuring out solutions to addition and subtraction problems, they are actually setting the stage for their work in algebra later in their schooling. We want to encourage kids to think flexibly about addition and subtraction, using strategies that make sense to them, so that we can build off of these strategies later. On the other hand, we want algebra teachers to be able to refer back to this kind of thinking when they are helping kids make sense of big ideas like variables. After all, something like $6 + ? = 9$ isn't so different from something like $6 + x = 9$. Notice also that you might solve $6+x = 9$ by doing $9-6$, which connects the two solutions that we saw earlier. But for kids, there is often a distinction between the expression they might write down to describe their \emph{solution} and the expression or equation they might write down to describe their \emph{strategy}.

In fact, we would like you to consider all the different ways that we can place the question mark in an expression like
\[
A + B = C, 
\]
and how you might draw a different picture for each of these expressions.
\[
? + B = C, \quad A + ? = C, \quad A + B = ?
\]

Each of these equations is very closely related, and in fact there is often not a big distinction between when kids are using addition and when they are using subtraction. Frequently, children solve problems by rearranging blocks or other objects (or putting down more blocks or taking some away), and putting language like ``addition'' and ``subtraction'' on top of what kids are naturally doing is one role for the teacher. So, it's important to be able to recognize when kids are using addition (combing things together) and when they are using subtraction (taking things away), even if the child's solution to a particular problem isn't what you expected.

\begin{question}
How could you write three different story problems that correspond to the following equations?
\[
? - 4 = 10, \quad 14 - ? = 10, \quad, 14-4=?
\]
(As a bonus question, consider doing the same but replacing the subtraction with addition.)

\section{Mental Math}

As adults, one of the most useful mathematical skills we can have is the ability to make good estimates for any situation. Often, the process of making a good estimate depends on being able to make some calculations quickly in our minds. Children learn these kinds of strategies early in school, as they work with addition and subtraction. As early as first grade, children will be asked to add and subtract numbers using a variety of strategies. This practice helps children build their understanding of place value, to express their creative thinking using numbers and expressions, and build strategies for the kind of estimating they will do later in life. It's important for children to be able to calculate flexibly.

There are many ways to find the answer to addition and subtraction problems, and we hope that during this course you will see many of them and invent some new ones for yourself. We will take a look at a few examples in this section, and then continue to build on these ideas as we work with multiplication and division as well. 

When children are working on finding the answers to addition and subtraction problems, their main strategies should involve rearranging things in order to make the calculations easier for themselves. The first important tool they might use is called the commutative property.

\begin{definition}
The \dfn{commutative property of addition} says that we can add two numbers in either order and get the same total. In mathematical symbols, this means that for any two numbers $A$ and $B$, we have
\[
A + B = B + A.
\]
\end{definition}

When children are asked to add more than one number, they might also use the associative property. Notice that we only defined addition for two numbers at a time, so if we have three or more numbers to add, we must group them in pairs in order to use the meaning of addition.
\begin{definition}
The \dfn{associative property of addition} says that we can regroup numbers in different pairs (without changing the order of the numbers) and get the same sum. In mathematical symbols, this means that for any three numbers $A$, $B$, and $C$, we have
\[
(A + B) + C = A + (B+C)
\]
\end{definition}
Notice that the groupings changed, but the order of the numbers did not. However, we frequently combine the commutative and associative properties of addition when we make calculations, and together these properties say that we can rearrange sums in any way that we like.

Take a moment to draw some pictures in your notes explaining why these properties make sense with our meaning of addition using the examples of $7+2 = 2+7$ and $3+(8+6) = (3+8)+6$. We will do this more explicitly once we are ready to add in the properties of multiplication, but it's good to practice now.

Now, here is an example of how we can use these properties to calculate sums.

\begin{example}
Genevieve is working on the addition problem $5 + 9$. Here is her thinking.

\emph{First I swap the numbers so I am looking at $9+5$. Then I take one away from the $5$ and give it to the $9$ to make $10$. Then I have $4$ left, so the answer is $14$.}

Genevieve starts with the commutative property, which in this case tells her that $5+9 = \answer[given]{9} + \answer[given]{5}$. Many children find it easier to work on addition problems which have the larger number first, and the commutative property means that they can rearrange problems in order to put the numbers in this preferred order. Notice that this means that children only need to memorize about half as many addition facts, since if they know that $2+3=5$, for instance, they also know that $3+2=5$ as well. 

Next, Genevieve uses a common strategy sometimes called \dfn{make a ten}. When she says that she takes away $1$ from the $5$, she is actually splitting up the $5$ into $1+4$ and then regrouping the $1$ with the $9$ instead of with the $5$. This is an example of the associative property, where we see that $9+(1+4) = \left (\answer[given]{9} + \answer[given]{1} \right ) + \answer[given]{4}$.

If we were to write a sequence of equations describing Genevieve's strategy, we might write the following.
\begin{align*}
5 + 9 &= 9+5 \\
&= 9 + (1+4) \\
&= (9+1)+4\\
&= 10 + 4 \\
&= 14 \\
\end{align*}

\end{example}

While the properties we discussed are for addition, we can still use similar ideas to solve subtraction problems mentally.

\begin{example}
Hassan is working on the subtraction problem $64 - 38$. Here is his strategy.

\emph{ I know that $64$ is six tens and four, and $38$ is three tens and eight. I want to just take away the three tens but the eight is confusing me. So I'll round up the $38$ to be $40$, which is just four tens. Now I take away four tens from six tens, and that leaves me with two tens. I took away an extra two, so I'll add that back on and get $22$. Finally the $64$ also had four ones, so I need to add those back on as well. My answer is $26$.}

Hassan starts with a strategy of rounding $38$ up to $40$. If he was just estimating this number, he could nearly stop there: the answer will be close to $20$. But since he is looking for the actual answer, he needs to keep going.

Rounding up is also a fairly common strategy for these problems, and the rounding should be done in order to make the calculation easier. Hassan could have rounded down to $30$ as well, but $40$ is closer in this case. Notice that Hassan is replacing $38$ by $40 - \answer[given]{2}$ in his calculation. 

Next, Hassan uses his knowledge of place value to deal with the tens and the ones separately. He subtracts the tens first, and he is using the commutative and associative properties in order to deal with the four ones and the two ones at the end.

Notice that Hassan also has to add back the extra two that he subtracted. This strategy can be confusing for some children, and it might be easier to model with base ten blocks, a picture, or a number line to really see what is going on. 

If we write equations to describe Hassan's strategy, we might write the following.
\begin{align*}
64 - 38 &= 64 - 40 + 2 \\
&= (60 + 4) - 40 + 2 \\
&= (60 - 40) + (4 + 2) \\
&= 20 + (4 + 2) \\
&= 20 + (2 + 4) \\
& = (20 + 2) + 4 \\
& = 22 + 4 \\
&= 26
\end{align*}
\end{example}

Practice solving similar problems on your own!
