\section{Comparing fractions}

Now that we can tell when two fractions are equal to one another, we would also like to use our meaning of fractions to tell when one fraction is larger or smaller than another. Let's start with unit fractions.

\begin{question}
Say that we have two pizzas which are exactly the same. Which is larger: $\frac{1}{8}$ of the pizza, or $\frac{1}{9}$ of the pizza?

\begin{explanation}
It's always a good idea to start by drawing a picture, so let's take a look at our two pizzas. Even though pizza is typically round, we'll draw a rectangle to represent the whole pizza. (It's usually easier to draw roughly even pieces with a rectangle!)

\begin{center} \begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[thick] (0,0)--(3,0)--(3,2)--(0,2)--(0,0);
\node[below] at (1.5, 0) {one pizza};
\draw[thick] (5,0)--(8,0)--(8,2)--(5,2)--(5,0);
\node[below] at (6.5, 0) {one pizza};
\end{tikzpicture} \end{center}


Using our meaning of fractions, let's draw $\frac{1}{9}$ of the first pizza and $\frac{1}{8}$ of the second pizza. For the first pizza, the denominator tells us that we should cut it into $\answer[given]{9}$ equal pieces. For the second pizza, the denominator tells us that we should cut it into $\answer[given]{8}$ equal pieces. For each pizza, the numerator tells us that we should shade $\answer[given]{1}$ piece.

\begin{center} \begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[fill=red] (0,0)--(0.333, 0)--(0.333,2)--(0,2)--(0,0);
\draw[thick] (0,0)--(3,0)--(3,2)--(0,2)--(0,0);
\node[below] at (1.5, 0) {one pizza};
\draw[fill=red] (5,0)--(5.375, 0)--(5.375, 2)--(5,2)--(5,0);
\draw[thick] (5,0)--(8,0)--(8,2)--(5,2)--(5,0);
\node[below] at (6.5, 0) {one pizza};
\foreach \x in {0.333, 0.666, 1, 1.333, 1.666, 2, 2.333, 2.666} \draw[thick] (\x, 0)--(\x, 2);
\foreach \a in {5.375, 5.75, 6.125, 6.5, 6.875, 7.25, 7.625} \draw[thick] (\a, 0)--(\a, 2);
\end{tikzpicture} \end{center}

Now, which piece is larger? It's a little hard to tell just by looking at the picture, but we can use our reasoning for this. Since we have taken only one piece in each case, we can think about which of these pieces should be bigger. The first pizza was cut into $9$ equal parts, while the second was cut into only $8$ equal parts. Since the two pizzas are exactly the same, the one that got cut into more pieces will have smaller pieces. Think about it as if you are hungry and want to eat this pizza: would you rather share your pizza with $8$ other people, or would you rather share your pizza with $7$ other people? Fewer people to share with means that everyone gets a larger piece. So we see in this case that
\[
\frac{1}{8} > \frac{1}{9}.
\]
\end{explanation}
\end{question}

There were a few important points to remember from that question, and I hope you'll take some notes for your future explanations. First, we used the symbol $>$ to indicate which of the fractions is greater. The bigger, open end of the symbol always points towards the larger number, while the smaller, pointy end of the symbol always points towards the smaller number. We could have also written the answer above as
\[
\frac{1}{9} < \frac{1}{8}.
\]
Some teachers help students to remember how to point the symbol by drawing teeth on it or pretending it's an alligator's mouth. The alligator is always hungry and eats the bigger number.

The second thing to keep in mind is that this strategy only makes sense because the two pizzas are exactly the same. This is important when comparing any fractions. If the wholes aren't the same, the comparison doesn't really make sense. It would be hard to make sense of comparing $\frac{1}{8}$ of a gallon of water to $\frac{1}{9}$ of a pizza. Perhaps we could think about converting both wholes into pounds or ounces or another common unit of measure, but that would also mean we then would be using the same wholes to describe the fractions before we compare them.

Finally, we want to keep in mind that when using a strategy like this one, we not only pay attention to the denominator but also to the numerator. We had the same number of pieces of each pizza, so we only needed to consider the size of those pieces. If we were trying to compare $\frac{4}{9}$ of the pizza to $\frac{5}{8}$ of the pizza, we don't have the same number of pieces any more. But in this particular case we can still use our reasoning. Each of the $\frac{1}{8}$-sized pieces of pizza is still larger than each of the $\frac{1}{9}$-sized pieces of pizza. Also, we have more of those bigger slices, since our meaning of the numerator tells us we have 5 pieces of the $\frac{1}{8}$-sized slices  but only $4$ pieces of the $\frac{1}{9}$-sized slices. Since we have more of the bigger pieces of pizza, we have more pizza overall. In other words, 
\[
\frac{4}{9} < \frac{5}{8}.
\]

\begin{question}
Use a similar strategy as we used in the previous example to decide which of $\frac{11}{34}$ and $\frac{15}{29}$ is the larger fraction. Be sure to jot down notes about your thoughts!

Select the larger fraction below.
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$\frac{11}{34}$}
\choice[correct]{$\frac{15}{29}$}
\choice{The fractions are equivalent.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Use a similar strategy as we used in the previous example to decide which of $\frac{89}{90}$ and $\frac{79}{80}$ is the larger fraction. Be sure to jot down notes about your thoughts!

Select the larger fraction below.
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{$\frac{89}{90}$}
\choice{$\frac{79}{80}$}
\choice{The fractions are equivalent.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}


Another strategy we can use to compare fractions and help us practice with the meaning of fractions is to estimate.

\begin{question}
Which is larger: $\frac{7}{15}$ of a gallon of punch or $\frac{6}{11}$ of a gallon of punch?

\begin{explanation}

We want to estimate the fractions $\frac{7}{15}$ and $\frac{6}{11}$. We could draw a picture of these fractions, but it's going to be tough to get a picture that's accurate enough to give us good information in this case. Let's just use our reasoning instead.

Maybe you noticed that $\frac{7}{15}$ of the gallon of punch is pretty close to $\frac{1}{2}$ of the gallon of punch. In order to think about why this is true, you could perhaps use an equivalent fraction like $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{14}$ (how would you cut each piece of the gallon to show that these fractions are equivalent?), or maybe you can think about having $15$ cookies and dividing them up equally amongst $2$ friends. Each friend would get $7$ cookies, which a child might model with blocks or other objects, and there would be another cookie left over. Maybe you drew a picture of the fraction and noticed that about half of the gallon of punch was shaded.

Similarly, maybe you could also notice that $\frac{6}{11}$ of the gallon of punch is also close to $\frac{1}{2}$ of the gallon of punch. Try out a different strategy than you used on the previous fraction.

Now that we know both of these fractions are close to $\frac{1}{2}$, we can see if that helps us to determine which fraction is the larger one. We can see that
\[
\frac{7}{15} < \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
and that 
\[
\frac{6}{11} > \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
using the idea of the size of the pieces. Notice that we have the same numerators here so we only need to think about which pieces are larger!

Now, we can put these inequalities together in a string with all of them pointing the same way, putting our $\frac{1}{2}$ in the middle.
\[
\frac{7}{15} < \frac{1}{2} < \frac{6}{11}
\]
Since the $\frac{1}{2}$ of a gallon of punch wasn't part of our initial question, we can remove it from the middle.
\[
\frac{7}{15} < \frac{6}{11}
\]
So we found our answer by realizing that one of our fractions was less than $\frac{1}{2}$ of a gallon of punch, and the other fraction was more than $\frac{1}{2}$ of a gallon of punch. The fraction that's bigger than the half gallon is the bigger fraction overall.


\end{explanation}
\end{question}

Let's notice a few important ideas about this example as well. First, we should pay attention to the fact that the larger fraction in this case actually has the smaller numerator. It's tempting to think that a larger numerator means a larger fraction, but we have to consider both the numerator and the denominator when we compare fractions. Remember that the meaning of the denominator is about the size of the pieces, and the meaning of the numerator is about how many pieces we have. Both how many and what size they are need to be considered when we are comparing fractions.

Second, this strategy of estimating and comparing to other fractions that are easier for us to understand is called \dfn{using a benchmark}. The benchmark we used in the example was the fraction $\frac{1}{2}$ of our whole, but you can use this strategy with any other fraction that you understand more easily than the fractions you are trying to compare. For instance $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{2}{3}$, or even something like $\frac{5}{2}$ make great benchmarks to use. Kids in Grade 3 start working with fractions, but the denominators they work with are primarily restricted to $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, and $8$,  so these denominators are the ones that children should have the most practice with and make great denominators to use for benchmarks as children work with more and more denominators as they move through the rest of their education.

\begin{question}
Use a benchmark strategy to decide which is larger: $\frac{8}{33}$ of a bowl of soup or $\frac{11}{41}$ of the same bowl of soup. Be sure to write some notes about your thinking!

Select the larger fraction below.
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$\frac{8}{33}$}
\choice[correct]{$\frac{11}{41}$}
\choice{The fractions are equivalent.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}

The strategies we've used so far don't work for every pair of fractions that we might like to compare. For instance, if we wanted to compare $\frac{3}{11}$ and $\frac{4}{15}$, we can't think about the size and number of the pieces because we have more of the smaller pieces in this case and it's hard to tell whether that would balance out the fact that the pieces are smaller. And there's not really a clear benchmark fraction to use for comparing these. So, we will need a more reliable method for comparing fractions, and luckily we have two methods based on making equivalent fractions. Even though the previous methods don't always tell us which fraction is larger, they are still important for children to learn because they are such good practice for thinking about the meaning of fractions. Eventually we will expect children to move towards the methods using equivalent fractions, but estimating and thinking are two skills we never want to lose!


As we work through these methods, don't forget to practice using a picture to explain why our equivalent fractions are actually equivalent!

\begin{example}
Let's show that $\frac{4}{25} > \frac{2}{15}$.

Start by drawing a picture of these two fractions, using the same rectangle as a whole. One way to figure out which fraction is larger is by making all of the pieces in both pictures exactly the same size. Since the wholes are exactly the same, that's the same as making the two denominators the same.

One way to do this would be to split each of the 25 pieces into 15 more equal pieces, and to split each of the 15 pieces into $25$ more equal pieces, leaving us with $375$ total equal pieces in each diagram. That sounds like a lot to count, but we could absolutely do it. However, there's an easier way: we can change the $25$ pieces into $75$ pieces by splitting each of the $25$ pieces into $\answer[given]{3}$ equal pieces. We can also split the 15 pieces into $75$ equal pieces by cutting each of the $15$ pieces into $\answer[given]{5}$ equal pieces. 

When we do this, each of the $4$ original pieces from the $\frac{4}{25}$ of our rectangle is split into $\answer[given]{3}$ equal pieces as well, so we end up with $\answer[given]{12}$ equal pieces, meaning that
\[
\frac{4}{25} = \frac{12}{75}.
\]
Similarly, each of the $2$ original pieces from the $\frac{2}{15}$ of our rectangle is split into $\answer[given]{5}$ equal pieces as well, so we end up with $\answer[given]{10}$ equal pieces. This means that
\[
\frac{2}{15} = \frac{10}{75}.
\]
Now, since all of our pieces are the same size and from the same whole, we can figure out which rectangle has the greater shaded region by comparing which one has more pieces shaded. The $\frac{4}{25}$ has $12$ pieces shaded while the $\frac{2}{15}$ only has $10$ pieces shaded, so we see that 
\[
\frac{12}{75} = \frac{4}{25} \answer[given]{>} \frac{2}{15} = \frac{10}{75}
\]
which is just what we wanted to show.
\end{example}

Let's practice noticing things about our solution again. We needed to have the same whole to compare our fractions, which is hopefully starting to feel like a habit. Our goal was to make all the pieces the same size so that we could just compare how many pieces we have. In other words, we made the denominators the same, and then just compared the numerators. Remember that this only works because the denominators are the same. Most of the time we still need to consider both the size of the pieces as well as how many there are.

\begin{definition}
The method where we change the fractions into equivalent fractions with the same denominator is called \dfn{making a common denominator}, and we use this strategy when we would like all of our pieces to be the same size using the same whole.
\end{definition}

However, there is actually an easier method we could use for the fractions in the previous example.

\begin{example}
We will show that $\frac{4}{25} > \frac{2}{15}$ using a different method.

Draw your rectangles again to be the wholes for these fractions. But this time, let's leave $\frac{4}{25}$ as it is, and change $\frac{2}{15}$ into an equivalent fraction that has the same numerator as the other fraction. In this case, we want the numerator to be $4$, so we are going to cut each of our pieces into $\answer[given]{2}$ equal pieces. This will turn our $2$ shaded pieces into $4$ shaded pieces, and it will turn the $15$ equal pieces in our whole into $\answer[given]{30}$ total equal pieces. So we see that
\[
\frac{2}{15} = \frac{4}{\answer[given]{30}}.
\]
Now, since the fractions have the same numerator or the same number of pieces, we can compare these fractions by thinking only about the size of the pieces. Using the same thinking that we used earlier in this section, we see that the \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{$\frac{1}{25}$-sized pieces} \choice{$\frac{1}{30}$-sized pieces}} are the larger ones, or in other words that
\[
\frac{4}{25} \answer[given]{>} \frac{4}{30} = \frac{2}{15}.
\]
And that's exactly what we wanted to show!
\end{example}

In this method, instead of making common denominators, we ended up making \dfn{common numerators}. Hopefully you agree that this made our calculations a little bit easier (and it certainly made our pictures a little easier to draw!) Instead of making the pieces all the same size, we made the total number of shaded pieces the same. In either of these methods, we are trying to make either the numerators or the denominators the same so that we only really have one thing to think about instead of thinking about both the size of the pieces as well as the number of pieces at the same time.

Choosing which method to use to compare fractions depends a bit on the fractions you are trying to compare. As you practice comparing fractions, be sure to write down notes about your thinking in each case so that you can describe how you selected the method you thought would be easiest in each case. There's not really one right answer for which method will be easiest, and we hope that by the time you are finished practicing this section that you have many methods you feel comfortable using.
