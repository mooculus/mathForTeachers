\section{Counting and base ten}

One-to-once correspondence helps us to know when one set is {\em bigger} than another, {\em smaller} than another, or that two sets are the {\em same size}. But using the idea of one-to-one correspondence can be a little time consuming, especially when our sets start to be very large. Instead, we might want to be able to count the number of items in our set, or assign some kind of symbol to the set which tells us how many items are in that set. Instead of lining up the items in each set, we can count the total number of items in that set and then use what we know about how those numbers are related to say which is bigger, smaller, or whether they are the same size. To do this, we need a whole bunch of new vocabulary: we'll need names for each of the quantities and we'll have to understand how those names are related to one another. Let's take things slowly.

\section{In the past}

Different cultures have approached the idea of counting in different ways. For instance, in \link[Ancient Egypt]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_numerals}, the first quantity (what we would call ``one'') was marked with a single line like this.

\begin{center}
\textpmhg{\Hone}
\end{center}

Next, another line would be added for the next quantity.

\begin{center}
\textpmhg{\Hone} \textpmhg{\Hone}
\end{center}

This would continue until we had (what we would call) nine lines.

\begin{center}
\textpmhg{\Hone} \textpmhg{\Hone} \textpmhg{\Hone} \textpmhg{\Hone} \textpmhg{\Hone} \textpmhg{\Hone} \textpmhg{\Hone} \textpmhg{\Hone} \textpmhg{\Hone}
\end{center}

But for the next symbol, the Ancient Egyptians invented something new.

\begin{center}
\textpmhg{\Hten}
\end{center}

Then, the Ancient Egyptians would write numbers by combining together however many ones and tens they needed to express their numbers. But that also meant they needed another new symbol for what we would call one hundred.

\begin{center}
\textpmhg{\Hhundred}
\end{center}

This would continue on. Each time you couldn't write the number you wanted, you needed a completely different symbol to express the number you wanted. And while this looks pretty cool when you write numbers like (what we would call) $13,412$

\begin{center}
\textpmhg{\HXthousand} \textpmhg{\Hthousand} \textpmhg{\Hthousand} \textpmhg{\Hthousand} \textpmhg{\Hhundred} \textpmhg{\Hhundred} \textpmhg{\Hhundred} \textpmhg{\Hhundred} \textpmhg{\Hten} \textpmhg{\Hone} \textpmhg{\Hone}
\end{center}

perhaps you get the feeling that this was a lot to memorize and could get a little tedious. We won't ask you to write numbers in Ancient Egyptian, but we want you to have something to compare our modern system with!

In \link[Ancient Rome]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals}, they had a similar idea which you might have seen at some point in your life. They used I for what we would call one, V for what we would call five, X for what we would call ten, and so on. They also had a special case for something like IV (what we would call 4) where if a smaller number came before a bigger one, you would subtract the smaller quantity from the larger one instead of adding. Compare IV to VI in Roman numerals! So again, while we could write big numbers like

\begin{center}
MCMLXXXIX
\end{center}

you might already be feeling a little overwhelmed with interpreting all of those quantities and how they are related to one another! (Don't worry, we won't ask you to write Roman numerals either!)

\section{The idea of bundling}

Both of the systems we've already discussed rely on inventing a new symbol every time you run out of symbols to describe the quantity you are trying to write. This is a perfectly acceptable strategy, and both math and science continued to develop for thousands of years under such systems. But mathematicians decided we could probably come up with something that's a little more efficient, especially for writing bigger numbers. Let's see this in action.

So that we can see what's happening without our own thoughts about counting getting in the way, let's say that we've invented a counting system where we will use the symbols $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, and $0$ (the usual zero, a symbol that means we have nothing). We don't know any other symbols, so the usual $1, 2, 3$ and words like ``one'', ``two'', ``three'' and so on don't mean anything to us at the moment. Let's start to count using some little beads to visualize how many we have.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0} 
	\draw (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
\node[below] at (0,-0.2) {$A$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
This quantity is called $A$ because it's the smallest one in our list. (We'll assume that the quantities get larger as we move further in the list.) Now let's add another bead to our collection.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0,0.5} 
	\draw (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
\node[below] at (0.25,-0.2) {$B$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
This quantity is called $B$ because it's the next one in our list after $A$. Let's add yet another bead.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 0.5, 1} 
	\draw (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
%\node[below] at (0,-0.2) {$A$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{question}
What would we call the quantity in the above picture? $\answer[given]{C}$
\end{question}

Let's draw the quantities $D$ and $E$ in the next picture.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6} 
	\draw (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
\node[below] at (0.75,-0.2) {$D$};
\node[below] at (5,-0.2) {$E$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

I hope this feels pretty good so far, but it's time to jump into the deep end of the pool! Let's add another bead.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5} 
	\draw (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
\node[below] at (1.25,-0.2) {?};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

What should we call this quantity? If we lived in Ancient Egypt or Rome, we would just invent a new symbol (maybe like $F$) to describe this quantity. But remember that we're trying to be more efficient and use {\em only} the symbols that we were given. There's no inventing new symbols here and we decided to use only the letters $A$ through $E$ to write our quantities! Notice that we also don't want to use only our zero to describe this quantity, because zero should mean we have nothing, and there's clearly something here.

Instead, let's invent something new that we will call a \dfn{bundle}. Now, instead of just counting our individual beads, we can also count how many bundles we have. We'll also draw a circle around our bundles to indicate that we are counting those beads as a unit - as a bundle.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5} 
	\draw (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
	\draw[thick] (1.25, 0) ellipse (2cm and 0.5cm);
\node at (1.25,-0.8) {?};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

But how do we write down this quantity? In addition to the idea of a bundle, we need the idea of a \dfn{place value}. In other words, we decide that when we write two numbers next to each other, the one farthest to the right will tell us how many loose beads we have, and then the next one to the left will tell us how many bundles we have. In the previous case, we have no loose beads, so we can write this with a zero, and then we have $A$ amount of bundles. Remember that $A$ is the smallest quantity we have that's not zero, because it's at the beginning of our list!

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5} 
	\draw (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
	\draw[thick] (1.25, 0) ellipse (2cm and 0.5cm);
\node at (1.25,-0.8) {$A0$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

We have written an $A$ in the ``bundles place'' and a $0$ in the ``individuals place''. Let's place another bead down and see if we can keep counting.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4.5} 
	\draw (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
	\draw[thick] (1.25, 0) ellipse (2cm and 0.5cm);
\node at (3,-0.8) {$AA$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

We've called this quantity $AA$ because we can see that we have $A$ amount of loose beads, so we place an $A$ in the rightmost place, and then we have $A$ amount of bundles, so we place an $A$ in the next place left as well.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4.5, 5} 
	\draw (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
	\draw[thick] (1.25, 0) ellipse (2cm and 0.5cm);
\node at (3.25,-0.8) {?};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{question}
If we place another bead in our picture of $AA$ and get the picture above, what would we call this quantity? $\answer[given]{AB}$
\end{question}

We can keep placing beads and counting, since we can now express a lot of different quantities.  Here is an example after we have added a bunch of individuals.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5} 
	\draw (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
	\draw[thick] (1.25, 0) ellipse (2cm and 0.5cm);
	\draw[thick] (5.75, 0) ellipse (2cm and 0.5cm);
\node at (5.25,-0.8) {?};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{question}
What would you call the  quantity above which has $B$ amount of bundles and $D$ amount of individuals? $\answer[given]{BD}$
\end{question}

We can now count for a little while before we get stuck again.

\begin{question}
Pause and think: what is the highest value you can count in this system with just bundles and superbundles?

The video below will talk us through how to keep counting once we get stuck again.

\begin{question}
What would you call the quantity pictured below, with $A$ amount of superbundles, $C$ amount of bundles, and $E$ individual sticks?

	\draw (\x, \y) circle (3pt);
   \foreach \y in {0, 1, 2}
	\draw[thick] (1.25, \y) ellipse (2cm and 0.5cm);
   \foreach \y in {0, 1, 2}
	\draw[thick] (5.75, \y) ellipse (2cm and 0.5cm);
\draw[very thick] (-0.75,-0.5)--(7.75,-0.5)--(7.75,2.5)--(-0.75,2.5)--(-0.75,-0.5);

\foreach \x in {13.5, 14, 14.5, 15, 15.5}
	\draw (\x, 0) circle (3pt);

\begin{prompt}
$\answer[given]{ACE}$
\end{prompt}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
What would you cal a quantity that had $B$ individual sticks, $A$ amount of bundles, $E$ amount of superbundles, and $E$ amount of mega bundles?

\begin{prompt}
$\answer[given]{EEAB}$
\end{prompt}
\end{question}

Let's wrap up this section by summarizing what we did.

\begin{definition}
\dfn{Place value} is a way of writing quantities where the position of a particular digit in a number determines its value. For example, a $B$ in the bundles place doesn't mean only $B$ objects, it means we have $B$ amount of bundles. We create these place values when we create new types of objects we want to count. A \dfn{bundle} is the first new type of object we create, and we make one when we are out of symbols to use to keep counting. The next type of new object we make is a \dfn{superbundle}, which we could also think of as a bundle of bundles. We can keep making new kinds of objects, and new place values to go with them, to count as high as we want without creating any new symbols.
\end{definition}




\section{Hindu-Arabic numerals}

While you are hopefully getting the hang of bundles and superbundles, we don't usually count with letters. Instead, we use the symbols $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, $9$, and zero ($0$). This collection of symbols works just like the $A$ through $E$ system that we were just using, but we have a different number of symbols, so our bundles look a little different. Let's start counting to see, using our small beads again.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 1, 1.4, 2.4, 2.8, 3.2, 4.2, 4.6, 5, 5.4} 
	\draw (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
\node[below] at (0,-0.5) {$1$};
\node[below] at (1.2,-0.5) {$2$};
\node[below] at (2.8,-0.5) {$3$};
\node[below] at (4.8,-0.5) {$4$};
\node at (6.4,0) {$\dots$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Once we get to $9$ beads and another bead, we are out of symbols to use.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2, 2.4, 2.8, 3.2, 4, 5.2, 5.6, 6, 6.4, 6.8, 7.2, 7.6, 8, 8.4, 8.8} 
	\draw (\x, 0) circle (3pt);
\draw[thick] (7, 0) ellipse (2.2cm and 0.5cm);
\node at (3.6, 0) {$+$};
\node at (4.5, 0) {$\rightarrow$};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{question}
How would you write down the quantity that comes after 9?

\begin{prompt}
	$\answer[given]{10}$
\end{prompt}
\end{question}

While you might be thinking that the answer to the previous question is ``ten'' (and you're not wrong), it's helpful to also be able to think about it as ``one-zero'', meaning we have one bundle and zero individuals leftover. 

\begin{question}
How would you write the quantity of beads where we have $8$ bundles and $3$ individuals?

\begin{prompt}
	$\answer[given]{83}$
\end{prompt}
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Think about the quantity that we would write as 59, and draw a picture of this quantity.

How many bundles did you use? $\answer{5}$

How many loose individuals did you use? $\answer{9}$

How many sticks would you need all together (counting the ones that are loose and the ones that are in the bundles? $\answer{59}$
\end{question}

We can also make superbundles in this system. We start with $99$ sticks, drawn as $9$ bundles and $9$ individuals.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2, 2.4, 2.8, 3.2, 3.6} 
\foreach \y in {0, 1, ..., 8}
	\draw (\x, \y) circle (3pt);
\foreach \y in {0, 1, ..., 8}
	\draw[thick] (1.8, \y) ellipse (2.2cm and 0.5cm);
\foreach \x in {0, 1, ..., 8}
 	\draw (4.5, \x) circle (3pt);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Now, if we add another individual to this collection, the $9$ loose beads plus the extra bead will make enough for another bundle. But now we have $9$ bundles and another extra bundle, and we don't have a symbol beyond $9$ to write this down. Instead, we bundle up all of these bundles into a superbundle, create a place value to record the number of superbundles, and then count superbundles, bundles, and individuals. We've highlighted the last bead (or stick) blue so that you can see how it completed that extra bundle.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\foreach \x in {0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2, 2.4, 2.8, 3.2, 3.6} 
\foreach \y in {0, 1, ..., 9}
	\draw (\x, \y) circle (3pt);
\foreach \y in {0, 1, ..., 9}
	\draw[thick] (1.8, \y) ellipse (2.2cm and 0.5cm);
\draw[thick, blue] (3.6, 9) circle (3pt);
\draw[very thick] (-0.75,-0.5)--(4.25,-0.5)--(4.25,9.5)--(-0.75,9.5)--(-0.75,-0.5);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{question}
How would we write down the quantity consisting of one superbundle, no loose bundles, and no loose sticks?

\begin{prompt}
	$\answer[given]{100}$
\end{prompt}
\end{question}

We can now continue counting with just the symbols $0$ through $9$ to numbers as large as we'd like. Many of our place values have special names, like when we call the bundles place the ``tens'' place, or the superbundles place the ``hundreds place'', but we don't need to have names for the places to be able to understand numbers like this one.

\[
7,363,849,937,475,643,839,475,765,637,383,948,575,646,379,202
\]

That's a very powerful system!

The counting system we use today is called the \link[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system} because it was first developed by mathematicians in India and then refined by mathematicians in the Middle East. The Hindu-Arabic numeral system is also called a place value system in base ten, where ``base ten'' means that we have ten unique symbols, counting zero, that we use to write our numbers. Our base ten system is essential to understanding so much of the way that we do mathematics today that we would like you to be very comfortable with it by the time you leave this course!

\begin{question}
How is the base-ten system similar to and different from the $A$ through $E$ counting system that we used above?

We want to finish up this section by thinking a bit about the special challenges that kids can face learning to count in our system.
