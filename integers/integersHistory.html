<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent">We look at integers from a historical point of view.
</p></div>
<div class="maketitle"></div>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">You might have noticed that there is one common class of numbers that we haven’t much discussed, yet: negative
numbers. One of the choices that the author of your textbook has made is to discuss the various kinds of operations
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as a whole, including many of the types of numbers in the
discussion. This helps to highlight the fact that multiplication, for instance, is the same thing no matter
what kinds of numbers you use. Other textbooks take a different approach: looking at whole numbers
and their operations, then fractions and their operations, and so on. We happen to think that our
textbook has made the better choice (and you can agree or disagree), but we have deviated a little in this
instance.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="noindent">Now that you have noticed these facts, you might be wondering: why?
</p><!--l. 18--><p class="noindent">There are several reasons, but the ones we would like to discuss here are the pattern of history and the difficulty of
finding a good representation.
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="noindent">These two reasons are very much related. If we look over how numbers as a concept were developed throughout
history, we definitely find evidence of whole numbers by <script type="math/tex">3000</script>BC in Ancient Egypt. Beginning around the same period of
time in Ancient Babylon, people were starting to use a place-value system which included what we would call
decimals, except the Ancient Babylonians used base <script type="math/tex">60</script> instead of base <script type="math/tex">10</script> as we do. The Ancient Egyptians also had
notation for unit fractions, and elaborate methods of combining these unit fractions to express any other fraction
they would like. If you’re interested in this subject, you can find a nice timeline of very early mathematics at
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Chronology/30000BC_500BC.html">MacTutor</a>.
</p><!--l. 24--><p class="noindent">So, we have seen evidence of whole numbers, fractions, and even decimals from the beginning of mathematics.
Negative numbers, however, are a different story. We see the first evidence of negative numbers appearing sometime
between <script type="math/tex">200</script>BC and <script type="math/tex">200</script>AD in Chinese mathematics, and around the <script type="math/tex">7</script>th century AD in Indian mathematics. Western
European mathematicians didn’t start really using negatives in their calculations until the <script type="math/tex">17</script>th century AD, and
didn’t allow them as answers to problems or give them equal status amongst the positive numbers, decimals, and
fractions until the <script type="math/tex">19</script>th century!
</p><!--l. 26--><p class="noindent">To emphasize this point a little bit, here are some things that happened in history before most Western
mathematicians were working with negative numbers. </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a> are developed in India and the Middle East around the <script type="math/tex">6</script>th and <script type="math/tex">7</script>th centuries.
     They are brought to Western Europe in the early <script type="math/tex">1200</script>s.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The bubonic plague hit Europe and Asia in the mid <script type="math/tex">1300</script>s.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Gutenberg invents the printing press around <script type="math/tex">1440</script>.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Christopher Columbus sails to the New World around <script type="math/tex">1492</script>.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Michelangelo begins painting the Sistine Chapel around <script type="math/tex">1508</script>.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Martin Luther publishes his 95 theses, and the Reformation begins around <script type="math/tex">1517</script>.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Galileo finds the Earth revolves around the sun around <script type="math/tex">1613</script>.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Descartes and Fermat invent coordinate geometry around <script type="math/tex">1637</script>.

     <li class="itemize">Isaac Newton and Wilhelm Leibniz invent calculus around <script type="math/tex">1670</script>.</li></ul>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent">(Of course, any such list leaves out an incredible number of important events! Our list here is focused on Western
history, as these events are usually more familiar to people who have studied history in the United States. Also, in
this time period, mathematics in Western Europe tended to be advancing more rapidly than in other parts of the
world. You can find other world history timelines online if you are interested, such as <a href="https://www.fincher.org/History/WorldAD.shtml">World History AD
Timeline</a>.)
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="noindent">Much of mathematicians’ hesitation to treat negative numbers as actual numbers came from the idea that
mathematics was a subject that should make sense in the real world, and model real-world phenomena. People
didn’t have a very good representation for negative numbers that made sense all the time. For example, let’s
consider a few problems.
</p>
<div role="article" class="problem-environment question" id="problem1"><a id="x1-31r1"></a> For each of the problems below, write an expression that would solve the problem, i.e. <script type="math/tex">3+4</script>.
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (a) </dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">Jaci has 8 apples, and Joseph has 12 apples. How many apples do the two children have together? <script type="math/tex">\answer {8+12}</script>
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (b) </dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">Jaci has <script type="math/tex">\frac 12</script> of an apple, and Joseph has <script type="math/tex">\frac 57</script> of an apple. How many apples do the two children have together?
     <script type="math/tex">\answer {\frac 12 + \frac 57}</script>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (c) </dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">Jaci has <script type="math/tex">-8</script> apples, and Joseph has <script type="math/tex">-12</script> apples. How many apples do the two children have together? <script type="math/tex">\answer {-8 + -12}</script></dd></dl>
</div>
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent">Now, you might say that negative numbers weren’t too bad in that situation: after all, you could likely answer the
question because you’ve recognized the structure of addition is the same in all three cases. But what does the
problem actually mean? What does it mean to have <script type="math/tex">-8</script> apples? Maybe you can reconcile this, as Indian
mathematicians did in their earliest interpretations, to mean that Jaci owes someone <script type="math/tex">8</script> apples, and Joseph owes
someone <script type="math/tex">12</script> apples, and perhaps this interpretation of negative numbers as debts makes sense in some
cases.
</p><!--l. 54--><p class="noindent">Let’s try another example.
</p>
<div role="article" class="problem-environment question" id="problem2"><a id="x1-35r2"></a> For each of the problems below, write an expression that would solve the problem, i.e. <script type="math/tex">3+4</script>.
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (a) </dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">Sasha has 8 bags, and each bag contains 12 sheets of stickers. How many sheets of stickers does Sasha
     have in total? <script type="math/tex">\answer {(8)(12)}</script>
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (b) </dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">Sasha has <script type="math/tex">\frac 12</script> of a box of stickers, and the box originally contained <script type="math/tex">\frac 57</script> of a sheet of stickers. How many
     sheets of stickers does Sasha have? <script type="math/tex">\answer {\frac 12\frac 57}</script>
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (c) </dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">Sasha has <script type="math/tex">-8</script> bags, and each bag contains <script type="math/tex">-12</script> sheets of stickers. How many sheets of stickers does Sasha
     have in total? <script type="math/tex">\answer {(-8)(-12)}</script></dd></dl>
</div>
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent">Again, you could likely answer the third question, but the meaning here is likely even less clear. The
question itself doesn’t even seem to make sense – we have just asked what looks like the right question
based on the patterns in the previous two parts. If we understand the objects in the groups to be
debts, what does it mean to have a negative group? Why should the overall answer to this question be
positive?
</p><!--l. 67--><p class="noindent">We will look at several kinds of models for these problems in order to try to make some sense of negative numbers,
and hopefully be able to write story problems that make sense. We expect this to be pretty challenging: after all,
mathematicians struggled to make sense of these ideas for centuries!
