\begin{instructorIntro}
This activity should introduce students to the notion of experimental probability and help students to start making connections between the counting methods we discussed previously and their application to probability problems.

You should have a discussion in the first two problems about the outcomes possible in this experiment as well as whether those outcomes are equally likely.  There are three important theories which should come up.
\begin{itemize}
	\item There are 11 total possibilities (the sums themselves), each one equally likely.
	\item There are 21 total possibilities (smaller number, larger number), each one equally likely (sometimes we see this as 42 possible sums).
	\item There are 36 total possibilities (red die, pink die), each one equally likely.
\end{itemize}
The data produced in the final problems is intended to help students choose between these theories, especially once everyone's data is collected together.  It's not too difficult to look at several hundred or a thousand data points here, especially if you can get the students to do the dice rolling at home before they come to class.

\timing{This activity is intended to take one class period.}
\end{instructorIntro}

Suppose that you roll two six-sided dice: one is red, and the other is pink.  You are interested in the sum of the two dice.

\begin{problem}
How many different outcomes are possible when rolling these two dice?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} 
Are you more likely to roll a sum of two or a sum of eight?  Or, are these two things equally likely?
\end{problem}

With a partner, roll a pair of dice at least 100 times, and record the sum of the two dice in a table.  You can physically roll the dice, or use an online dice roller like \url{http://www.roll-dice-online.com/} (which will roll them all at once) or \url{http://www.dicesimulator.com/} (where you can tally them as you roll).


\begin{problem}
Based on the table of results you just made, what is the probability of rolling
\begin{enumerate}
\item a sum of two?
\item a sum of seven?
\item a sum of eight?
\end{enumerate}
Were your earlier predictions correct?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Using reasoning (not our data), what is the probability of rolling
\begin{enumerate}
\item a sum of two?
\item a sum of seven?
\item a sum of eight?
\end{enumerate}
How close are these values to the ones predicted by the chart?  How could we make them closer?
\end{problem}
