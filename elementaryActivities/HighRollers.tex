\begin{instructorIntro}
This activity should introduce students to the notion of experimental probability and help students to start making connections between the counting methods we discussed previously and their application to probability problems.

You should have a discussion in the first two problems about the outcomes possible in this experiment as well as whether those outcomes are equally likely.  You can mention the three ``theories'' of ``Which Road Should We Take?'', but hopefully students will come up with these ideas themselves.
\end{instructorIntro}

Suppose that you roll two six-sided dice: one is scarlet, and the other is grey.  You are interested in the sum of the two dice.

\begin{problem}
How many different outcomes are possible when rolling these two dice?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} 
Are you more likely to roll a sum of two or a sum of eight?  Or, are these two things equally likely?
\end{problem}

With a partner, roll a pair of dice at least 100 times, and record the sum of the two dice in a table.  You can physically roll the dice, or use an online dice roller like \url{http://www.roll-dice-online.com/} (which will roll them all at once) or \url{http://www.dicesimulator.com/} (where you can tally them as you roll).


\begin{problem}
Based on the table of results you just made, what is the probability of rolling
\begin{enumerate}
\item a sum of two?
\item a sum of seven?
\item a sum of eight?
\end{enumerate}
Were your earlier predictions correct?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Using reasoning (not our data), what is the probability of rolling
\begin{enumerate}
\item a sum of two?
\item a sum of seven?
\item a sum of eight?
\end{enumerate}
How close are these values to the ones predicted by the chart?  How could we make them closer?
\end{problem}
