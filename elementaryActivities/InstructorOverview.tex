\title{Instructor Overview: Math for Elementary Teachers Activities}

\begin{abstract}\end{abstract}\maketitle

Many of these activities come from Ohio State, where we have a two-semester course sequence of mathematics
content for preservice elementary school teachers.  The courses are each five credit hours, and run five days per 
week.  Many of the activities are designed to take the whole class period, or 55 minutes, while others use 
approximately half the class, or about 25-30 minutes.  The instructor notes attached to the activities often give a 
suggested amount of time for the activity, but reference the 55-minute ``class period''.
