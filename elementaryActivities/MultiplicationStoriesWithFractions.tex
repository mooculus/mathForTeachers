\begin{problem}
 Solve each of the following stories using a picture.  Then, compare your solutions.  Be sure to address:   
\begin{itemize}
    \item How are the pictures alike?  How are they different?
    \item Can these situations be viewed as multiplication?  Do they fit with our usual meaning of multiplication?
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}%[label=(\alph*)]
    \item My mom's oatmeal cookie recipe calls for 3 cups of oatmeal.  
I want to make 2 batches.
How much oatmeal will I need to make this?
    \item My mom's oatmeal cookie recipe calls for 3 cups of oatmeal.  
I want to make $\frac{2}{5}$ of a batch.
How much oatmeal will I need to make this?
    \item My mom's new oatmeal cookie recipe calls for $\frac{4}{7}$ cup of oatmeal.  
I want to make 2 batches.
How much oatmeal will I need to make this?
    \item My mom's newest oatmeal cookie recipe calls for  $\frac{4}{7}$ cup of oatmeal.  
I want to make $\frac{2}{5}$ of a batch.
How much oatmeal will I need to make this?

\begin{problem}
 Write an expression involving multiplication which represents the story below, then solve the problem using a picture or pictures.  Be ready to explain how you drew your picture and what it means.  How does the picture tell you the answer?

\emph{I have a container that holds $\frac{5}{8}$ of a gallon when it is full.  Today, my container is $\frac{2}{3}$ full of milk. How much milk is in the container?}

 For each of the stories below, first write an expression involving multiplication which represents each of these stories.  Then, solve either version of this problem using pictures.  Be ready to explain how you drew your picture and what it means.  How does the picture tell you the answer? 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item I walked for  $\frac{3}{4}$ of an hour at a speed of  $\frac{7}{5}$ miles per hour.  How far have I walked?
    \item Rewrite the story in (a) so that it is the same multiplication problem using \emph{containers} and \emph{gallons}.

\emph{A Cub Scout troop decided to make their own chocolate-covered popcorn for the annual sale, but they ate $2 \frac{1}{3}$ batches of the popcorn before selling any! If each batch of popcorn used $\frac{6}{5}$ of a pound of chocolate, how much chocolate did the Scouts eat?}

\begin{instructorNotes}
This activity is ambitious in attempting to use these problems to first introduce students to the concept of multiplying fractions by building on the definition of multiplication for whole numbers, then help review the pictures they've drawn to solve each problems for patterns in their work.  These patterns should eventually yield the usual multiplication rule for fractions.  

In our course, this activity follows discussion of multiplication for whole numbers, so we can build off of that structure.  One goal we have in grouping operations together for the different classes of numbers is to help students see that the operation is unchanged - for instance, multiplication works the same way whether we work with whole numbers, decimals, fractions, or even negative numbers (with this last class of numbers coming later in our course).  The first problem in the activity helps us discuss this concept.

In small groups, students draw pictures to solve the problem, share their solutions, and discuss how their drawings illustrate the definition of multiplication.  The rest of the problems after the first one are for more practice with solving these problems by drawing a picture rather than a rule or a calculator.  Drawing and interpreting their pictures is a struggle for many students with these problems, which is why we have so many for practice.

We use whole class discussion to share the different pictures and analyses more broadly and also provide time for the class to ``step back''  and observe any patterns they see.  This should hopefully bring up the usual procedure in the pictures, as well as other observations.  We usually don't try to start this ``stepping back'' part of the activity until students are feeling more comfortable with solving the problems and seeing the answers in their pictures.

{\bf Suggested Timing:} We spend two or three class periods to fully discuss this activity.  The first two days are spent on solving problems, generally following our pattern of letting students work for 5-10 minutes, then stopping to discuss for about 15-20 minutes, and repeating.  The first problem in the activity often takes us a full class period.  The final day we spend more in whole-class discussion, clearing away misconceptions, making observations about patterns, and justifying our observations.  Generally we try to give students time in their groups to make these observations and try to justify them before discussing as a class.
