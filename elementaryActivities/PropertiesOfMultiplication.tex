\begin{problem}

 Each of the following diagrams could be thought of as a picture for a certain multiplication problem in several ways.  For each diagram, write as many multiplication expressions as you can see in the picture.  You might need parenthesis or even some addition in your expression!  Be sure to explain your thinking!
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength\itemsep{1cm}
    \item \leavevmode\vadjust{\vspace{-\baselineskip}}\newline {\huge \tt
        \begin{tabular}{cccccccccccc}
            X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X\\
            X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X\\
            X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X\\
            X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & X\\
        \end{tabular} }
    \item \leavevmode\vadjust{\vspace{-\baselineskip}}\newline {\large \tt 
        \begin{tabular}{p{0.5cm}p{0.5cm}p{0.5cm}p{0.5cm}p{0.5cm}p{0.5cm}p{0.5cm}p{0.5cm}p{0.5cm}p{0.5cm}p{0.5cm}}
            XX\newline XX & & XX \newline XX & & XX\newline XX & & XX \newline XX & & XX\newline XX & & XX\newline XX  \\[0.3cm]
             XX\newline XX & & XX \newline XX & & XX\newline XX & & XX \newline XX & & XX\newline XX & & XX\newline XX  \\
        \end{tabular} }
    \item \leavevmode\vadjust{\vspace{-\baselineskip}}\newline {\huge \tt
        \begin{tabular}{p{1cm}p{0.5cm}p{1cm}p{0.5cm}p{1cm}p{0.5cm}p{1cm}p{0.5cm}p{1cm}}
            OO \newline XXX & & OO \newline XXX & & OO \newline XXX & & OO \newline XXX  \\[0.3cm]
            OO \newline XXX & & OO \newline XXX & & OO \newline XXX & & OO \newline XXX  \\
        \end{tabular} }
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
 For at least two of the multiplication expressions you found in each part in the previous problem, write a story problem which would be answered by that expression.  Trade stories with a partner to test your writing skills!

\begin{instructorNotes}
This activity is designed to help students see why the commutative, associative, and distributive properties of multiplication are true.  Emphasize throughout that we have two expressions for the exact same number of items, so it makes sense to put an equals sign between them.  

Students are usually very creative with their expressions, especially in part (a).  Try to elicit a lot of responses before guiding the discussion around to the general case.  

Remember to emphasize that we are considering specific examples here, and a full explanation for why the properties hold should attend to other arrangements of objects (for other numbers) as well.

{\bf Suggested Timing:} This activity should take about half a class period.  The other half can nicely be spent on some mental math questions.
