\begin{problem}
Describe similarities and differences between the following word problems by considering how a student who has never dealt with division before might attempt to solve these problems.

\begin{enumerate}
\item We have a total of 35 hard candies.  If there are 5 boxes with an equal number of candies in each box with all the candy accounted for, how many candies are in each box? (What happens if we start with 38 pieces of hard candy?)

\item We have a total of 35 hard candies.  If there are 5 candies in each box, how many boxes are there? (What happens if we start with 38 pieces of hard candy?)

\item We have a total of 38 gallons of milk to be put in 5 containers.  If each container holds the same amount of milk and all the milk is accounted for, how much milk will each container hold?

\item We have a total of 38 gallons of milk to be put in containers holding 5 gallons each.  If all the milk is used, how many containers were used?


\item  A rectangle has length 5 inches and area 35 square inches.  What is its width?


\item  A chart has 35 cells and 5 rows.  How many columns does it have?


\item John has a total of 35 outfits (shirt and pant combinations) he can wear.  If he has 5 shirts, how many pants does he have?

\item John has 5 times as many candies as Cindy.  If John has 35 candies. how many candies does Cindy have?
\item If John has 35 candies and Cindy has 5 candies, how many times as many candies does John have than Cindy?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{instructorNotes}
As with the Multiplication Word Problems, we ask students to think about how young children who have not yet learned division would solve the problems using objects or drawings.  The purpose is to help students develop the different models of division through discussion of a series of story problems.  \underline{After} discussion of the worksheet and students' solutions, we describe the two models of division: {\em how many groups?} and {\em how many in each group? }

\begin{itemize}
	\item Refer to Multiplication Word Problems Handout as these go hand-in-hand.  To shorten the discussion, you can do and discuss the first problems (a and b), run through the rest, and then go on to other activities.
	\item It is important to identify the ``groups'' and the ``objects'' in each story problem - relate to how each model (``{\em how many groups}'' and ``{\em how many per group}'') was solved in Division Word Problems.
	\item Some of the multiplication models need to have two kinds of reversals:  Repeated addition and Ratio.  The rest essentially just have one (and a symmetrical one).  
	\item Discuss also the {\em repeated subtraction} solution process for each model in Division Word Problems.  For ``How many per group'', give one to each group and take inventory at each stage.  With ``How many groups'', give $b$ to one group and take inventory after each stage.
	\item Note another difference between \#1ab and \#1cd is how the remainder is treated because we are dealing with hard candies in one case and milk in the other.  Discuss the fact that the remainder has a different unit than the quotient.  
	\item Ask what we need to do after each subtraction (do we have enough to do it again? And when does the magic time when we don't have enough occur:  unique quotient and remainder:  $a = bq + r$ with $r < b$).  Deal with the ``continuous'' contexts in how to write the answer as a mixed number with appropriate units (e.g., in ``how many per group'', pass out $\frac15$ gallon per container until you run out). 
\end{itemize}



{\bf Suggested Timing:} This will take the whole class period, about 15 minutes in groups, about 15 minutes presenting at the board, and about 20 minutes in discussion.
