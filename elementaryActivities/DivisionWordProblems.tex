\begin{problem}
Describe similarities and differences between the following word problems by considering how a student who has never dealt with division before might attempt to solve these problems.

\begin{enumerate}
\item We have a total of 35 hard candies.  If there are 5 boxes with an equal number of candies in each box with all the candy accounted for, how many candies are in each box? (What happens if we start with 38 pieces of hard candy?)

\item We have a total of 35 hard candies.  If there are 5 candies in each box, how many boxes are there? (What happens if we start with 38 pieces of hard candy?)

\item We have a total of 38 gallons of milk to be put in 5 containers.  If each container holds the same amount of milk and all the milk is accounted for, how much milk will each container hold?

\item We have a total of 38 gallons of milk to be put in containers holding 5 gallons each.  If all the milk is used, how many containers were used?


\item  A rectangle has length 5 inches and area 35 square inches.  What is its width?


\item  A chart has 35 cells and 5 rows.  How many columns does it have?


\item John has a total of 35 outfits (shirt and pant combinations) he can wear.  If he has 5 shirts, how many pants does he have?

\item John has 5 times as many candies as Cindy.  If John has 35 candies. how many candies does Cindy have?
\item If John has 35 candies and Cindy has 5 candies, how many times as many candies does John have than Cindy?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{instructorNotes}
As with the Multiplication Word Problems activity, students think about how young children who have not yet learned division would solve the problems using objects or drawings.  The goal is to help students develop the different models of division through discussion of a series of story problems.  \underline{After} discussion of the worksheet and students' solutions, we describe the two models of division: {\em how many groups?} (also known as measurement division) and {\em how many in each group? } (also known as partitive division).

\begin{itemize}
	\item It is important to identify the ``groups'' and the ``objects in each group'' in each story problem - relate to how each model (``{\em how many groups}'' and ``{\em how many per group}'') was solved in the activity.
	\item Discuss also the {\em repeated subtraction} solution process for each model in Division Word Problems.  For ``How many per group'' problems, we distribute one object to each of the groups and take inventory at each stage.  In the ``How many groups'' problems, we distribute a given amount to one group, take inventory, and repeat.  In both problem types, we ask what we need to do after each subtraction (do we have enough to do it again?). The magic time when we don't have enough and the process ends occurs when we have a unique quotient and remainder:  $a = bq + r$ with $r < b$).  
	\item These problems give an opportunity to pay attention to different types of appropriate remainders -- sometimes we report a whole number and remainder solution, sometimes we round up to the next whole number, sometimes we report a mixed number answer.  All of these types are represented in these problems. 
    \item You might want to refer to Multiplication Word Problems activity, as these go hand-in-hand.  To shorten the discussion, you can do and discuss the first problems (a and b), run through the rest, and then go on to other activities.
\end{itemize}



{\bf Suggested Timing:} This will take the whole class period, about 15 minutes in groups, about 15 minutes presenting at the board, and about 20 minutes in discussion.
