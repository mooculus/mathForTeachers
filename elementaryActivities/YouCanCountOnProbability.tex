\begin{instructorIntro}
In this activity, we take the problems from ``You Can Count On It Getting More Difficult'' and rephrase them as probability problems.  Students should pay attention to whether the outcomes are equally likely, and use the work they have previously done to answer these problems.

\timing{One class period for this activity.  If you're behind with other activities, you can choose which parts your students will most benefit from.  The final problem is difficult.}

\begin{problem}
You choose a card from a deck consisting of 10 distinct cards.  Though the cards are all distinct, four of them are blue, two are red, and the rest are yellow.  Then you roll a six-sided die.  What is the probability that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item you draw a blue card?
\item you draw a blue card and roll a 1?
\item you draw a blue or yellow card and roll an odd number?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
A class has 10 children, three of which are named Jay.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability that if you choose a group of three children, exactly one of them will be named Jay?
\item What is the probability that if you choose a group of three children, at least one of them will be named Jay?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
