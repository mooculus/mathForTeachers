\begin{instructorIntro}
The idea in this activity is to get the students to see the generalizability of the ``same direction'' definition of parallel lines as opposed to the still-useful (in 2-D) lines that never intersect.  It is much easier to argue with the concept of direction (for both ``angle'' and ``parallel'') in making sense of the Parallel Postulate.  As with vertical angles, transitory arguments may be difficult for some to grasp.
\end{instructorIntro}


\begin{question}
How should we define ``parallel lines'' if the lines are on a flat piece of paper?  Will your definition always make sense if the two lines are in three dimensions (perhaps use pencils to model your 3-D lines)?
\end{question}









\begin{problem} \label{Euclid1}
The converse of the Parallel Postulate says that we can check that two lines are parallel by checking for congruent {\bf corresponding angles} (a and b in the picture below).  Why is this a reasonable assumption? That is, what would happen if angles a and b were not equal?

\end{problem}







\begin{problem}
Assuming $a = b$, argue why angles b and c should also be of equal measure (we call these {\bf alternate interior angles}).
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
In the figure above, label all of the angles with letters.  Then, make a list (or more than one list) of all angles which are equal to each other.
\end{problem}
