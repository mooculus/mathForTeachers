\begin{instructorIntro}
    This activity is intended to introduce the notion of dimension.  
    
\timing{10-15 minutes in groups, followed by 10-15 minutes of discussion.}
    
\end{instructorIntro}

\begin{problem}
    With your group, list at least four one- two- and three-dimensional aspects of a house.
    
    \begin{solution}
        Answers will vary for this question.  Here are some examples:\\
        One dimensional: the length of the house.\\
        Two dimensional: the square footage of the house.\\
        Three dimensional: the number of moving boxes that will completely fill the attic.
    \end{solution}
    
    \begin{instructorNotes}
        This question should be straightforward for students, though students occasionally have trouble correctly identifying which dimension coincides with the aspects they suggest.  In this case, suggest that students go back and test their answers to the first question using their answers to the second.
        
        This should be the ``observe'' phase of students' investigation.  Here, they are exploring what dimension means in order to be able to define it in the next question.  The idea that students should identify four aspects in each dimension should help them to come up with creative answers beyond the obvious.
    \end{instructorNotes}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    In your own words, what is ``dimension''?  How would you describe this idea to a child in Kindergarten?  How would you help a fourth-grader who is struggling with this concept?
    
    \begin{solution}
        In Kindergarten, children should be able to distinguish whether something is like a line, whether it is flat, or whether it takes up space.  As children get older, it might help to think about how many directions one could move within the space (though you should be careful with this idea).
    \end{solution}
    
    \begin{instructorNotes}
        Students will hopefully come up with the idea of dimension as being ``how many directions can we move in this space?''  This is subtle, of course, and its subtleties should be pointed out.  Two dimensions actually produces an infinite number of ways to move, though all of these ways can be built out of two.  In essence, we're describing the vector space nature of $\mathbb{R}^2$, but not using this terminology.
        
        Answers will vary for the differences between kindergarten and fourth grade.  Kindergarteners are taught about the idea of dimension in basic ways, in that they should be able to describe the difference between a flat (2D) object and one that takes up space (3D).  By fourth grade, students should have a deeper understanding of dimension, so this could be a more complicated discussion.

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Sally claims that the amount of gutter on the side of your house is two-dimensional, because it goes around both the length and the width of the house.  Discuss Sally's claim.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Suzi argues that the amount of carpet in your house is three-dimensional, while Shawn argues that it is two-dimensional.  Could both be correct?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
You have an antique grandfather clock that you would like to move into your new house.  What kind of measurements would you need to take in order to determine if the clock will fit in the house?  What dimensions are associated with these measurements?  Repeat the question for your over-sized couch.

\begin{solution}
There are many things to be considered here, so answers will vary.  Try to think not just of the usual one-dimensional measurements (like the length of the couch or the height of the clock), but also of two-dimensional (or even three-dimensional) measurements that you could take into consideration.

If students struggle with this question, you can bring up the more traditional question of one-, two-, and three-dimensional aspects of a lake.
\end{solution}

\begin{instructorNotes}
This question should give students a chance to demonstrate their understanding of dimension.  There should be multiple aspects that need to be measured for each item: for instance, you would need to measure the (one-dimensional) height of the ceiling in order to determine if the grandfather clock will fit.  However, you should also measure the (one-dimensional) width of the door to determine if you will be able to fit the clock through the door!  Alternatively, you could consider the square footage of the side of the clock and compare with the square footage of the door, but a direct comparison here is less useful.  This is a good concept to discuss with students.
\end{instructorNotes}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    What would it mean for an object to be 0-dimensional?  Give some examples and explain your reasoning.
    
    \begin{solution}
        The best way to think about this right now is to think of a zero-dimensional object as just a dot, or as something you would count with numbers.  An example is the number of floors in the house above, or the number of windows in the house.
    \end{solution}
    
    \begin{instructorNotes}
        Students should use this question to test their definitions of dimension from the previous problem.  They should still be able to make sense out of dimension in the 0-dimensional case, whether they consider a 0-dimensional object to be an angle (does not change under scaling) or a point (no directions in which to move).
    \end{instructorNotes}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    What would it mean for an object to be 4-dimensional?  What about $n$-dimensional, for $n$ greater than 4?
    
    \begin{solution}
        This is a bonus question!  Four dimensions is just like three, except there is an extra way to move around.  This is really hard to imagine, though, since we live in a 3-dimensional world.
    \end{solution}
    
    \begin{instructorNotes}
        This problem is optional, and should not be discussed in class.  This is a more ``mathematically oriented'' problem for advanced students to use to extend their ideas if they have a very solid grasp on the first three problems.
