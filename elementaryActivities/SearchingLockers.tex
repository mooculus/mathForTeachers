\begin{problem}
At Fermat High School, where there are 100,000 lockers and 100,000 students, a strange tradition has developed over the years.  Every April 1, the students line up outside of the building and go into the building one at a time.  Student $\#1$ starts at Locker $\#1$ and opens every locker.  Then, Student $\#2$ starts at Locker $\#2$  and closes every other locker.  Then Student $\#3$ starts at Locker $\#3$ and ``switches" every third locker (i.e., closes it if it was open and opens it if it was closed).  Then Student $\#4$ switches every fourth locker.  If this process continued, after all the students had taken their turns, which lockers would be open?  Why?

\begin{instructorNotes}
This is often the first number theory activity that we do.  Solving the problem gives us the chance to define some terminology related to number theory, such as even, odd, prime, factor, multiple, and so on, as the students use these ideas to explain their thinking about the problem.

The activity is also a chance for students to do some problem solving - it's unusual for someone to see the pattern right away.  Suggest that they try a smaller number of lockers to get started, though many students will try 10 lockers to start and not be convinced that they found much of a pattern.  Encourage them to keep going!

{\bf Suggested Timing:} This will take about a full class period, but it can also be nice to split over two periods so that students can go home and think about some of these ideas without immediate resolution.  In that case, you'll want about half a class each day.
