\begin{instructorIntro}
This activity leads students to justify the volume formula for right rectangular prisms.  Just as they placed squares on top of lines to justify the area formula for rectangles in Building Blocks, they will place unit cubes on top of squares in this activity.  The key idea of this exercise is the subtle reasoning about the volume formula for prisms.  The students will create layers of cubes.  The volume of one layer of cubes is the same number of volume units as the area of the base.  This observation, which can be applied to all prisms (and cylinders, in fact), justifies the volume formula for a prism $V = Ah$.

\timing{This activity should probably take about 1/2 of a class period.}

{\bf Possible Extensions:}
Using Cavallieri's Principle to see that the same formula applies to other cylinders, not just right cylinders. If students remember Building Blocks well, this activity could lead to a discussion of three-dimensional arrays.

\begin{problem}
First measure the area of the rectangle below.  Describe how you would build a rectangular prism with volume $8$ cubic inches with its base on the rectangle.

%\vspace{1 in}
\tikz{ \draw (-2 in,-1 in) -- (2 in,-1 in); \draw (-2 in, -1 in) -- (-2 in, 1 in); \draw (-2 in, 1 in) -- (2 in, 1 in);\draw (2 in, 1 in) -- (2 in, -1 in);\draw (-2 in, -1 in) -- (2 in, -1 in); \draw(-2 in, 0)--(2 in, 0);\draw(-1 in, -1 in)--(-1 in, 1 in);\draw(0 in, -1 in)--(0 in, 1 in);\draw(1 in, -1 in)--(1 in, 1 in);}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Using the same base, build a rectangular prism with volume $24$ cubic inches.

\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
We are familiar with the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism $V = \ell \times w \times h = A \times h$.  Using the meaning of multiplication (groups and objects per group), explain why this formula is accurate.

\begin{instructorNotes}
It's worthwhile to point out that the area (which is 2-dimensional) gives us a number of (3-dimensional) volume units.  This is the hardest part of the activity.  The idea of a 1-1 correspondence between the area units covering the base and the volume units in the first layer might help both here and in the next problem.
\end{instructorNotes}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} 
Think about a right circular cylinder.  How can you justify the volume formula $V = \pi r^2 h$?
