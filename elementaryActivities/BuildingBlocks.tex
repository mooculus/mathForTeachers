\begin{instructorIntro}
This activity is meant to be a precursor to Building Blocks Revisited.  In this activity, students are instructed to create rectangles as arrays of squares.  The activity can educe the concepts of arrays, areas of rectangles, and in the later problems, nonstandard units of area.  The key point to make in this activity is the idea that the area formula for rectangles, while literally a product of two lengths, can really be thought of as $A = $ (number of rows) $\times$ (number of area units per row).

Supplies needed: some 1 inch by 1 inch by 1 inch cubes (or 1 inch by 1 inch squares) and pattern blocks.



\timing{This activity takes about 1 class period.  Have the students work through the first three problems, then discuss and try to elicit the idea of the area formula described above.  Then have the students move on to the last three questions.}

\begin{problem} 
Measure the length of the line below; then using plastic tiles or a ruler, build a rectangle with area $4$ sq. in. with its base on the line.

\vspace{1 in}
\tikz{ \draw (-2 in,0) -- (2 in,0); \draw (-2 in, -2 pt) -- (-2 in, 2 pt); \draw (-1 in, -2 pt) -- (-1 in, 2 pt);\draw (0 in, -2 pt) -- (0 in, 2 pt);\draw (1 in, -2 pt) -- (1 in, 2 pt); \draw (2 in, -2 pt) -- (2 in, 2 pt);}


\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Build a rectangle with area $12$ sq. in. with its base on the line.

\vspace{3.25 in}
\tikz{ \draw (-2 in,0) -- (2 in,0); \draw (-2 in, -2 pt) -- (-2 in, 2 pt); \draw (-1 in, -2 pt) -- (-1 in, 2 pt);\draw (0 in, -2 pt) -- (0 in, 2 pt);\draw (1 in, -2 pt) -- (1 in, 2 pt); \draw (2 in, -2 pt) -- (2 in, 2 pt);}


\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
 We are familiar with the formula for the area of a rectangle $A = \ell \times w$.  Using our Math 1125 interpretation of multiplication, explain why this formula is accurate.


\end{problem}


Let's repeat the same questions with a new unit of area, pictured below.

\tikz{ \draw (0 cm,0) -- (2.3 cm,0); \draw (2.3 cm, 0) -- (3.5 cm, 2 cm); \draw (3.5 cm, 2 cm) -- (1.2 cm, 2 cm);\draw (1.2 cm, 2 cm) -- (0 cm, 0);}  = 1 unit of area


\begin{problem}
Build a parallelogram with an area of $4$ units on the line below.

\vspace{2.5 cm}
\tikz{ \draw (0 cm,0) -- (9.2 cm,0); \draw (0 cm, -2 pt) -- (0cm, 2 pt); \draw (2.3 cm, -2 pt) -- (2.3cm, 2 pt);\draw (4.6cm, -2 pt) -- (4.6 cm, 2 pt);\draw (6.9 cm, -2 pt) -- (6.9 cm, 2 pt); \draw (9.2 cm, -2 pt) -- (9.2 cm, 2 pt);}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Build a parallelogram with an area of $12$ units on the line below.  Then build a parallelogram with an area of 20 units, and finally one with an area of 8 units.  What area formula is emerging?

\vspace{6.5cm}
\tikz{ \draw (0 cm,0) -- (9.2 cm,0); \draw (0 cm, -2 pt) -- (0cm, 2 pt); \draw (2.3 cm, -2 pt) -- (2.3cm, 2 pt);\draw (4.6cm, -2 pt) -- (4.6 cm, 2 pt);\draw (6.9 cm, -2 pt) -- (6.9 cm, 2 pt); \draw (9.2 cm, -2 pt) -- (9.2 cm, 2 pt);}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Draw a new unit of area.  Now swap units of area with someone else in your group.  Can you draw a shape whose area in those units has the formula we noticed above?

\end{problem}
